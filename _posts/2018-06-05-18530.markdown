In an industry that tends to be quiet by design, a new international firm is deliberately making noise.Headquartered in the United Arab Emirates, The big money comes paired with an earnest promise of ÂtransparencyÂ that is unique in an industry where secrecy is standard operating procedure.Crowdfense director Andrea Zapparoli Manzoni told CyberScoop that he wants to Âdo things differently.ÂThe zero-day industry uncovers Â through research or by purchase Â exploits in computer systems and then sells them to the highest bidder.Â Many governmentsÂ and even some private companies are involved in the business. Crowdfense shares a lot in common with its closest competitor Zerodium didnÂt respond to a request for comment.Oppressive regimesÂ can turn the potent tools against their own citizens while these developers rake in the cash. The well-known companies, like IsraelÂs NSO Group,Â make overÂ $200 million in sales per year, according to one employee of that firm. Other big players include ItalyÂs HackingTeam and GermanyÂs Gamma Group.ÂThis sector has no proper regulation,ÂÂ Manzoni said. ÂAll you can do is try to self-regulate and do no evil.ÂManzoni, an Italian citizen, wants to build a successful and ÂdecentÂ zero-day business by following a set ofÂ self-imposed rules that focuses in on one point: ÂWe deal only with countries with track records of human rights respect.ÂManzoni says Crowdfense, which is headquartered in the tech-rich United Arab Emirates, does not sell to nondemocratic regimes. The company doesnÂt work Âwith Asia or dictatorshipsÂ and it Âtries to avoid selling to countries where revolutions and civil wars are going on.ÂÂWhen tools get sold to nondemocratic countries, itÂs inevitable that dictatorships will use it to go after their internal population,Â Manzoni said.Crowdfense also doesnÂt build Âmass surveillance tools,Â instead focusing on exploits that can be used in highly focused operations against less than a dozen targets, he said.The policy of avoiding selling zero-day exploits toÂ certain countries certainly sets Crowdfense apart. But itÂs an interesting choice for a companyÂ headquartered in a nondemocratic Asian countryÂ notoriousÂ for both its love of new and expensive technologyÂ alongside its longstanding and continuing In many ways, the UAE is a great place to start a business. ItÂs home to the second-largest economy in the Persian Gulf region, fueled mostly by oil exports. The country offers extraordinaryÂ recruitingÂ packagesÂ to foreign technology talent including tax exemptions and paid-for housing, food, health care, education and transportation. For tech startups hungry for both cash and talent, thatÂs a hard package to ignore.The country is also known for its use of highly focused zero-day exploits to spy on and detain internationally-celebrated human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was recently sentencedÂ to 10 years in prison for insulting the country.ManzoniÂ stressed that there is no way to know how the companyÂs customers use its tools, due to the nature of their work. But ÂitÂs easier for us to vet our customers,Â he said, becauseÂ the company isÂ supporting actions like Âsting operations by law enforcement agenciesÂ rather than doing mass-surveillance work for the highest bidder.For a company throwing $10 million prizes into the public arena, questions quicklyÂ arose about the firmÂs funding. The blog Intelligence Online When asked about the source of the companyÂs funding,Â ManzoniÂ declined toÂ give a specific answer one way or the other despite the transparency plea. He did, however, say that part of the reason Crowdfense is headquartered in UAE is to attract better investment.ÂWe were funded by a pool of international investors,Â he said. ÂItÂs a new way of doing this kind of thing so itÂs a high risk that it wonÂt work. ItÂs a big question mark.Â
