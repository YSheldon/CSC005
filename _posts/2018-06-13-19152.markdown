On the eve of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, we take a closer look at the possible cybersecurity risks that exist on sports streaming websites tttttttttttttttWith the start of FIFA World Cup just a day away on June 14, many fans will be looking for streaming sites where they can watch the matches taking place at Russia 2018. If you are one of them it is important that you understand the security risks that you will be exposed to if you do not take sufficient precautions.Several of these sites are illegal (piracy issues) and many are used by cybercriminals to disseminate campaigns that go beyond theAnd were not just talking about invasive advertising, which by the way these websites are awash with. We are referring to malicious campaigns designed to take advantage of the anxiety of many soccer fans who are looking for a way to view the matches and when caught up in World Cup fever, they become more exposed to risks as their desire to watch the matches sometimes outweighs commonsense.To show some examples, we carried out a simple search on Google  just as soccer fans looking to watch the games this way would do. This simple search gave us more than one million results. We searched several of the sites that the search engine offered and we found numerous threats. Below, we show you some of the most common threats to watch out for. [Editors Note: The following research was done by our colleagues in Buenos Aires and therefore contains some images in Spanish] Example of Google searchIt should be noted that not all these sites have a malicious component. Even so, the examples that we will show are some of the threats that appear with greater recurrence after searching the first ten pages of search results.On some of the sports streaming pages, once the user enters they are automatically redirected to other websites with social engineering campaigns that seek to trick them into stealing personal information. On some sites, just entering the browser automatically redirected us to two social engineering campaigns.The first consists of a supposed survey and the possibility of winning a prize. This is done with the sole intention of knowing what browser the user is using. Example of a page that aims to find out what type of browser the user is usingOnce the user completes the survey, the possibility of winning the last available device in the days draw is offered as a reward.Example of the reward on offerIn the end, the only thing that the user is asked to do is to make a minimum payment to have the prize delivered. No matter how many times you try to enter your credit card number the user will be met with a message telling them that the payment was not authorized. The only people who really win, however, are the ones behind this campaign, as they keep the credit card details.Not authorized card payment message displayed to userThe second campaign that uses the social engineering format tries to convince the user to enter their cell phone number and their personal identification document (along with other personal information), which usually ends in a subscription to SMS Premium messaging services.Example of the type of trick used to convince the user to enter their cell phone number and their personal identification documentThe malicious codes implemented into video players hide add-ons or extensions that seek to be installed on the users device with the objective of obtaining personal information many times.Example of hidden trojanWhile these type of detections are not associated with applications that seek to steal information from users, they can be quite annoying because of the amount of advertising they show and also because in some cases they redirect to sites that contain more dangerous threats.During the searches we conducted we found websites where  Example of sites we found from our Google search with different types of active minersObviously, if the user does not have a security solution or browser add-on that blocks (and alerts) this type of connection, the resources of their device will be used for cryptocurrency mining without warning.If you thought that using a mobile device would spare you from cryptocurrency miners, we have some bad news for you as some miners come prepared exclusively to mine on this type of devices. Cryptocurrency miners are also working on mobile devicesWhile the above site was not related to the streaming sites used to watch soccer matches, it did, however, show up in the results of the initial search.As we said at the beginning of this article, these are just some examples of what a user can find when surfing the internet looking for streaming sites to watch World Cup matches. While not all the sites we visited had malicious behavior  beyond an excessive burden of annoying advertising  some did register behaviors that pose some risk to the user.This post is not intended to be an exhaustive study of everything that the user can find but merely a simple example to show how close threats are when trying to find a stream to watch soccer. If you do intend to watch the action via streaming sites we strongly advise the importance of being protected with a security solution when doing so.tttttttttttttttttttttttttt
