Two US senators have proposed a bill this week that aims to address the issues with software and IT services provided to the US government and its agencies.Named the "Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act" (FASCSA), the bill addresses "supply-chain attacks," a term used to describe cyber-incidents when an attacker compromises a target's software in order to gain visibility inside its operations.The purpose of this new bill is to create a special council —named the Federal Acquisition Security Council— that will be tasked with reviewing software and services together US intelligence agencies and drafting policies and recommendations to prevent the US government from using software from contractors with ties to other governments.The bill is a direct reaction to the recent scandals that have involved Kaspersky Lab and ZTE.Last year, the US government Kaspersky rejected the claims and unsuccessfully tried to have the ban lifted, only to see it spread to other countries such as This year, the US government Also this year, on the same fears that Chinese companies provide data to the Chinese government, US legislators have The new FASCSA wants the Council it plans to set up will be tasked with determining current supply-chain threats and help the US government shed some of its suspicious IT suppliers and avoid signing new contracts.The Council will have to work together with the US public and private intelligence and cyber-security communities. According to "We need to have a system in place that will allow us to address risks before it becomes an issue nationwide," "This bipartisan bill will help to clarify each government agencies' role and responsibility and protect the federal government from IT security threats through strengthening supply chain risk management," he added."Our bill creates a government-wide approach to solving supply chain security issues in federal acquisitions," the Senator added
