一个在线反病毒产品服务SCA4YU的运营商已经被美国检察官指控并定罪。星期四，美国司法部（DOJ），这位37岁的拉脱维亚“非公民”，即前USSR公民，一直居住在首都里加。拉脱维亚被指控犯有密谋违反计算机欺诈和滥用法的罪名，一项阴谋窃取窃听罪，一项电脑入侵企图破坏和协助教唆罪，罪名涉及SCA4YU，这是一项致力于网络犯罪的在线服务。该系统可以用来查看各种反病毒产品是否会检测到恶意代码——这对于恶意软件开发者在将它们的创作发布到野外之前是很重要的。BoDARS将服务从2009操作到至少2016。SCAN 4U可以用来检查一个最少的35个商业反病毒引擎。该服务的一个客户使用该服务来测试恶意软件，这是为了给美国零售商造成混乱。结果是窃取了大约4000万个信用卡和借记卡号码、7000万个地址、电话号码和其他来自客户的个人可识别信息（PII）。（尽管执法部门没有提及零售商，但除了这一事件之外，还有可能的是，其他SCA4YU客户在开发执法时显然使用了该服务，称CITADEL已经造成超过5亿美元的欺诈相关损失。“CITADEL开发者利用SCAN4U的一个特殊特性，允许其直接集成到CITADEL恶意软件工具箱T中。检察官补充道。API工具允许SCAN 4U用户在不需要直接向SCA4YU网站提交恶意软件的情况下扫描恶意软件。“SCAN 4U和合法服务包括ViuStoTalk之间可能存在比较，但也存在一些密钥差异。SCA4YU是特定的。向网络罪犯销售，并在互联网的更阴险的暗处进行广告。此外，该服务允许用户匿名上传文件，而不与网络安全社区共享任何数据。在2012的封锁URL系统中，这导致了五年的调查和起诉Bordas，和另一个管理员一起。“我们没有看到像VixCuffMID这样的竞争对手的用户有相当大的峰值，所以看起来调查对CycC有了真正的影响。“RIME地下，”研究人员说。判决定于2018年9月21日。“Bondars帮助黑客测试和改进他们使用的恶意软件，从而在美国公司和消费者身上造成数亿美元的损失。”代理助理司法部长Cronan说。J的刑事分裂。今天的判决应该对那些帮助和怂恿犯罪黑客的人起到警示作用：犯罪部门和我们的执法伙伴认为你和你所犯下的罪行一样是罪魁祸首。
tThe operator of Scan4You, an online counter antivirus product service, has been charged and convicted by US prosecutors.On Thursday, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) The 37-year-old Latvian "non-citizen," -- which means a citizen of the former USSR -- who has been living in Riga, the capital of Latvia, was charged on one count of conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and one count of computer intrusion with intent to cause damage and aiding and abetting.The charges relate to Scan4You, an online service dedicated to cybercriminals and malware developers.The system could be used to see whether or not a variety of antivirus products would detect malicious code -- which is invaluable for malware developers to ascertain before they release their creations into the wild.Bondars operated the service from 2009 to at least 2016 and offered Scan4You to hackers in return for a fee.Scan4You could be used to check a minimum of 35 commercial antivirus engines.One customer of the service used the service to test malware which was released in order to cause chaos for US retailers. The result was the theft of roughly 40 million credit and debit card numbers, 70 million addresses, phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information (PII) from customers.(Although law enforcement did not name the retailer in question, it is possible that In addition to this incident, another Scan4You customer apparently used the service while developing Law enforcement says that Citadel has caused over $500 million in fraud-related losses."The Citadel developer took advantage of a special feature of Scan4you that allowed its integration directly into the Citadel malware toolkit through an [...] API," prosecutors added. "The API tool allowed Scan4you users the flexibility to scan malware without the need to directly submit the malware to Scan4you's website."There may be comparisons between Scan4You and legitimate services including VirusTotal, but there is also a number of key differences.Scan4You was specifically marketed towards cybercriminals and was advertised in the more nefarious recesses of the Internet.In addition, the service allowed users to upload their files anonymously and without sharing any data with the cybersecurity community.Trend Micro A private exploit pack checked Trend Micro's web reputation system for blocked URLs in 2012, and this led to a five-year investigation and the prosecution of Bondars, alongside another administrator."We've not seen a sizeable spike in users of rival services such as VirusCheckMate, so it looks like the investigation has had a real impact on the cybercrime underground," the researchers say.Sentencing is scheduled for 21 September 2018."Bondars helped hackers test and improve the malware they then used to inflict hundreds of millions of dollars in losses on American companies and consumers," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan of the DoJ's Criminal Division. "Today's verdict should serve as a warning to those who aid and abet criminal hackers: the Criminal Division and our law enforcement partners consider you to be just as culpable as the hackers whose crimes you enable."
