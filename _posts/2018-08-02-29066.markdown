The developer of WireGuard has laid the groundwork for plugging his open-source privacy tool directly into the Linux kernel in hope of making secure communications easier to deploy and manage.Jason Donenfeld, creator of "Even as an out-of-tree module, WireGuard has been integrated into various userspace tools, Linux distributions, mobile phones, and data centers," said Donenfeld in the notes accompanying his patches. "There are ports in several languages to several operating systems, and even commercial hardware and services sold integrating WireGuard. It is time, therefore, for WireGuard to be properly integrated into Linux."WireGuard was developed as an alternative to secure tunneling protocols like IPSec and OpenVPN. Donenfeld has described these older protocols as "overwhelmingly difficult." WireGuard, at just under 4,000 lines of code, aspires to be simpler and more easily audited.Compare that to 100,000 lines of code for OpenVPN, which also requires OpenSSL, another 500,000 lines of code. Or consider Linux XFRM, an IPsec implementation that spans about 13,000 lines of code and may be used alongside StrongSwan for the key exchange, which runs about 400,000 lines of code.WireGuard guards layer 3, the network layer, in the OSI networking model. It uses In lieu of the complexity of IPsec and XFRM, WireGuard presents a virtual interface Â– "This is in a sense sort of blasphemous," said Donenfeld in late 2016 during a It's not quite heresy: WireGuard has been subject to Setting up your own VPN node is considered by many security experts to be preferable to free or commercial options, which have been known Other attempts to make secure communication more accessible have made progress as well.
