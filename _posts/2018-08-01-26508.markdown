The US military is drawing up a list of overseas organizations  primarily in Russia and China, funnily enough  that the Pentagon and its contractors shouldn't buy software from, citing security concerns.In The list is being compiled with the help of US defense contractor organizations including the Aerospace Industries Association, the National Defense Industrial Association, and the Professional Services Council."We had specific issues  that caused us to focus on this," said Lord. "What we are doing is making sure that we do not buy software that's Russian or Chinese provenance.
