The email was actually from Aleksey Lukashev, a senior lieutenant in Russian military intelligence, using the account john356gh to mask his purpose, the official Two days later, the Russian operatives stole  and later leaked  more than 50,000 of Podestas private emails throwing Clintons bid for the White House into turmoil.On Friday, the Justice Department indicted Lukashev and 11 other officers in the GRU for interfering in the 2016 presidential election by hacking and leaking tens of thousands of emails and other material from Clintons campaign, the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and others.Kevin remarked: "After reading the Russian indictment I was surprised to see that the Russians use the same exact methods we use to test our clients security controls. Our security engineers have never failed to get in when we can use Mitnick is KnowBe4's Chief Hacking Officer, and continued with: "The biggest takeaway was that spear-phishing is *still* the easiest way the bad guys get in. Why didnt the DNC use Multi-Factor Authentication is beyond me. I believe it is the lack of He ended off with: "How many of the GRU operators are going to frame the indictment and put it on their wall? It really means nothing as the USA could never touch them."The indictment showed that the Russian hackers targeted more than 300 people, covertly hacked and monitored dozens of computers secretly implanting a hacking tool that the GRU called X-Agent, as if from Marvel Comics.The malware allowed operatives in Moscow to remotely take screenshots and capture keystrokes of Democratic Party employees as they tapped on their computers, the indictment states. The GRU team used another program, called the X-Tunnel, to extract gigabytes of stolen documents through encrypted channels.A separate group called Unit 74455, under control of a Russian colonel and working from a building called the Tower northwest of Red Square, released the stolen information in stages  starting in mid-2016  using phony names like Guccifer 2.0 and Russian-controlled websites such as DCLeaks. It also spread anti-Clinton content on social media, according to the indictment.Between June 2016 and March 2017, when it was shut down, DCLeaks received more than one million page views. Although it claimed to be run by American hacktivists, it was operated by the GRU, prosecutors said.The Russians used an extensive network of servers to hide their tracks and funded the purchase of computer infrastructure using Bitcoin. Among other things, this enabled the hackers to pay a firm based in Romania to register a domain they used to distribute stolen content. They also tried to pass their attacks off as the handiwork of Guccifer 2.0, a lone Romanian hacker.When Democratic officials realized their systems had been penetrated, they called in a security firm. To dodge the investigators, the Russians tried to erase evidence of their penetration using CCleaner and emptying event logs.The indictment says the hackers got into the system of a state board of elections and stole information including names, addresses, dates of birth, and partial Social Security numbers related to half a million voters. They also hacked into the computer of an unnamed company that makes voter registration software.When we confront foreign interference in American elections, it is important for us to avoid thinking politically as Republicans or Democrats and instead to think patriotically as Americans, Mr. Rosenstein said, in calculated commentary that went beyond the just-the-facts style typical of his appearances."Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, speaking about Russian cyber influence at the Hudson Institute think tank shortly after the indictment was released, said U.S. intelligence agencies continue to see Russia attempting to create new social media accounts that pose as Americans in order to inflame political and social divisions.Intelligence agencies havent yet seen Russia attempt to hack election infrastructure as it did in the 2016 election, Mr. Coats said. However, he added, we fully realize that we are one click away from a similar situation repeating itself.Not so fast. Stepping government employees through Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats raised the alarm on growing cyberattack threats against the United States, saying the situation is at a "critical point" and coming out forcefully against Russia."The warning signs are there. The system is blinking. It is why I believe we are at a critical point," Coats said, addressing the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC, on Friday. "Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack," he said.The bad guys go after the humans. They hack the human as that is their path of least resistance....unless that human has been trained with new-school security awareness training and simply does not fall for social engineering attacks like this.
