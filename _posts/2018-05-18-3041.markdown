A new variant of the Mirai botnet has added at least three exploits to its arsenal, which enable it to target additional IoT devices, including routers and DVRs. The new version ofThe original version of Mirai was deployed to launch massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, but has also been modified for other meansWhile the original Mirai uses traditional brute force attacks in an attempt to gain control of IoT devices, Wicked uses known and available exploits in order to do its work. Many of these are old, but the inability of many IoT devices to actually install updates means they haven't been secured against known exploits. Vulnerabilities used by Wicked include a Netgear R7000 and R64000 Command Injection ( Following a successful compromise, Wicked download an additional payload in the form of Owari, another Mirai variant - although researchers found that the Owari bot samples could no longer be found in the website directory and Wicked was now downloading the Omni bot.According to Fortinet, this is the latest product by the malicious developer, although Owari had been previously distributed.Researchers have come to the conclusion that four IoT botnets - Wicked, Sora, Owari and Omni are all by the same author. "This also leads us to the conclusion that while the WICKED bot was originally meant to deliver the Sora botnet, it was later re-purposed to serve the author's succeeding projects,"IoT devices remain popular targets for cyber attackers - not only do they often lack the security built into other products,
