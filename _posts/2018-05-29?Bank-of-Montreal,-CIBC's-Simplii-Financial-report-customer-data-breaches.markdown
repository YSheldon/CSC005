加拿大最大的银行T2已经发出声明，确认他们与“欺诈者”联系，声称他们拥有客户的个人和财务信息。蒙特利尔银行（BOM）T T“欺诈者联系BMO声称他们拥有一定的个人和财务信息为有限数量的客户，”声明说。我们在事件发生时立即采取措施，我们确信与客户数据相关的曝光已经被关闭。”TBOM说，它已经通知并正在与相关部门合作，因为它继续评估形势。联系那些可能受到影响的客户，我们将支持和支持他们，”银行写道。T“BMO有强大和稳健的过程来保护客户数据，我们非常重视客户隐私。建议客户监视他们的账户，并通知任何可疑活动的BMO。“T TSimii金融公司，加拿大帝国商业银行（CITC）的直接银行子公司，”T SimulII金融公司建议客户，它已经实施了额外的在线安全我。声明回答说，在2018年5月27日星期日收到的索赔中，欺诈者可能已经为Simplii的客户中大约40000的人电子访问了某些个人账户信息。在得知潜在问题后，Simplii立即开始调查，了解索赔情况并验证其准确性。我们也迅速采取行动，加强网上欺诈监测和网上银行安全措施。“虽然有报道指出，加拿大隐私专员办公室已经得到通知，但在现阶段还没有正式声明。去年，至少有七家科技巨头仍然使用黑客利用的脆弱软件攻击Erimax。暴露的查找工具让任何人运行客户的电话号码，并获得他们的家庭地址和帐户PIN，用于联系电话支持。一个服务器存储青少年的苹果ID电子邮件地址和明文密码。信用卡号码、过期日期和卡验证码被盗。如果数据泄露很快成为数百万美元的事件，唯一的解决办法是增加IT预算，并给予技术领导者更大的组织决策声音吗？
 tTwo of Canada's largest banks have issued statements confirming they were contacted by "fraudsters" claiming to have personal and financial information on customers in their possession. tBank of Montreal (BOM)t t"Fraudsters contacted BMO claiming that they were in possession of certain personal and financial information for a limited number of customers," the statement reads. "We took steps immediately when the incident occurred and we are confident that exposures identified related to customer data have been closed off." tBOM said it has notified and is working with relevant authorities as it continues to assess the situation; reports indicate it hast"We are proactively contacting those customers that may have been impacted and we will support and stand by them," the bank wrote. t"BMO has strong and robust processes in place to protect customer data and we take customer privacy very seriously. Customers are recommended to monitor their accounts and notify BMO with any suspicious activity." t tSimplii Financial, the direct banking subsidiary of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), alsot t"Simplii Financial is advising clients that it has implemented additional online security measures in response to a claim received on Sunday, May 27, 2018 that fraudsters may have electronically accessed certain personal and account information for approximately 40,000 of Simplii's clients," the statement reads. t"Immediately upon learning of the potential issue, Simplii began investigating to understand the claim and verify its accuracy. We also moved quickly to implement enhanced online fraud monitoring and online banking security measures."While reports indicate the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has been notified, no official statement has been made at this stage. t tAt least seven tech giants still use the vulnerable software that hackers exploited to attack Equifax last year. t tExclusive: The exposed lookup tool let anyone run a customer's phone number -- and obtain their home address and account PIN, used to contact phone support. t tExclusive: A server stored teenagers' Apple ID email addresses and plaintext passwords. t tCredit card numbers, expiration dates, and card verification codes were stolen. t tWith data breaches rapidly becoming multi-million dollar events, could the only solution be increasing IT budgets and giving tech leaders a bigger voice in organizational decision making?
