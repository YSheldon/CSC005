DDoS attacks as a means of personal revenge grew more popular in Q1 2018. Also trending were Memcached attacks that resemble a typical DDoS attack; however, according to the Kaspersky report, “Cybercriminals will likely seek out other non-standard amplification methods besides Memcached.”     As server owners patch vulnerabilities, there will be dips in certain types of attacks. “That being the case, DDoS masterminds will likely seek out other amplification methods, one of which could be LDAP services,” the Kaspersky report authors wrote.       \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                  \tTechnology and science in the medical industry was a major focus in the Australian government's 2018-19 Budget, with the government providing AU$106.8 million over four years to modernise Medicare's IT systems.  \tThe funding will also be used to upgrade the systems across the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, aged care, and related payments.  \t\"This measure includes funding for replacing and decommissioning ageing ICT systems, upgrading cybersecurity, and introducing user experience improvements for consumers and providers of health and aged care services,\" the Budget documents said.  \tThe government is also providing AU$28.2 million over five years to upgrade the software system being used to prescribe medicines.  \t\"This measure supports a national electronic prescribing system that will contribute to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme efficiency, compliance, drug safety, and data collection,\" the government explained.         \t\"The upgrades will make the system more user-friendly and enable prescribers to better identify prescribing options that best meet the needs of their patients, with doctors to retain the final say in advising patients on which medicines to use.\"  \tUnder Improving Access to Medicines: E-prescribing for safer medicines, the Department of Health will get AU$13.7 million in 2018-19, AU$2.8 million in 2019-20, and AU$400,000 in 2020-21; while the Department of Human Services (DHS) gets AU$1.7 million in 2018-19, AU$4.3 million in 2019-20, AU$600,000 in 2020-21, and AU$600,000 in 2021-22.        \tThe government's new 21st Century Medical Industry Growth Plan also gained AU$1.3 billion in funding under the Budget unveiled on Tuesday.  \t\"Tonight we announce a new 21st century medical industry plan to create more jobs in this fast-growing sector of our economy,\" Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said in his Budget speech.  \t\"Our plan will provide more support for medical research projects, new diagnostic tools, clinical trials of new drugs, scientific collaboration, and development of new medical technologies that can be sold overseas.\"  \tThe plan will ensure Australia is a \"global health industry leader in medical technology, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals while improving health outcomes for all Australians through investments in medical innovation\", the Budget documents stated.  \tThe funding for the plan was divided into AU$500 million over 10 years for the Genomics Health Futures Mission and AU$707 million to support the Frontier Health and Medical Research program, clinical trials, Biomedtech programs, and Industry Researcher Collaborations.  \tUnder the plan, the government is also looking to spend AU$30 million on enhancing the data sharing and release capabilities of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.  \tThe government had also used the 2018-19 Budget to outline its  \tUnder Delivering Australia's Digital Future: Data sharing and release arrangements, AU$20.5 million over four years will be provided to establish a new framework for data sharing in response to the recommendations for an  \tThe framework will be underpinned by legislation and administered by a newly created National Data Commissioner (NDC), with technical guidance and support to be provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to federal agencies on best practices for de-identifying data prior to release.  \t\"A National Data Commissioner will implement and oversee a simpler, safer, and more efficient government data use framework. The National Data Commissioner will be the trusted overseer of the Government data system, responsible for proactively monitoring the integrity of the system and engaging with the community,\" the Budget papers said.  \t\"The NDC will be responsible for developing guidance on data sharing arrangements; monitoring and addressing risks and ethical considerations on data use; and managing the process for high-value datasets.\"  It’s finally time for the federal government to submit a proposal for raising Russia’s retirement age, acting Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told the State Duma on Tuesday, pointing out that the country’s current system was established in the 1930s. “Life in this country has changed substantially since then, of course for the better,” Medvedev Today, men in Russia can receive state pensions at 60 and women can retire at 55. Despite repeated warnings from state officials over the years that the country’s current pension program is unsustainable, the government has refused to entertain the idea of raising the retirement age. Beginning last year, the government started gradually increasing the pension age for civil servants and the minimum amount of employee tenure needed to claim a pension.

It found 5-20 times the number of breaches coming from smaller firms, although they are often not publicized because of the lower profile of these organizations, the vendor claimed.     “Smaller companies make easier targets because they don't have the resources to effectively defend themselves. Most attacks are automated, so it makes little difference to an attacker if they steal 1,000 personal data records from 100 smaller companies, or if they steal 100,000 personal data records from one company,” explained Terbium Labs CEO, Danny Rogers.     “UK small and medium sized businesses just don't have the volume to absorb a big data breach event, and it can cause so much damage that entire businesses can be destroyed. At the same time, these organizations have far fewer resources, not to mention much more limited data sets, to combat the problem. Currently, they’re sitting ducks.”     Nearly half (47%) of small businesses have experienced a breach or cyber-attack in the past 12 months, according to    Although spending on cybersecurity is higher as a percentage of total spend than other sized companies (33%), just 31% of micro-businesses and 39% of small firms said they have dedicated staff to deal with attacks, according to the government. This is versus 62% of medium and 76% of large businesses.     What’s more, just 39% of small businesses have formal security policies in place, versus 59% of medium and 74% of large firms.

There are a total of 21 critical CVEs to patch in May, one of which,    Microsoft explained further in an    “An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system.

If an attacker can’t gain privileged access, they could exploit an elevation of privilege bug such as the other CVE being exploited in the wild:    “This vulnerability allows an attacker who is logged onto a system to run a specially crafted file to gain privileged access to the system,” explained    There are also two public disclosures this month, meaning there’s enough info out there on how the vulnerabilities work that attackers could create exploits before firms have a chance to update their systems.

The DDoS onslaught cost device owners an average of $0.42 per hour in power, based on the distribution of devices in low, medium, and high-cost electricity zones. \tThe cost of bandwidth was more difficult to estimate, owing to low, medium, and high-cost zones, in addition to Wi-Fi and Ethernet options. However, as an aggregated amount, Berkeley researchers believe the Mirai-fueled DDoS attack cost $4,207.03 per hour. \tOn average, each device involved in the attack is estimated to have cost individual owners $13.50 per product. \t\"The attacker who wanted to clobber my site paid a few hundred dollars to rent a tiny portion of a much bigger Mirai crime machine,\" Krebs noted. \"That attack would likely have cost millions of dollars to mitigate. The consumers in possession of the IoT devices that did the attacking probably realized a few dollars in losses each, if that.\" \t\"Perhaps forever unmeasured are the many Web sites and Internet users whose connection speeds are often collateral damage in DDoS attacks,\" the security expert added. \t\tThis may be unnoticeable to many especially when there are no bandwidth caps in place, but the operating costs of fending off Mirai attacks and similar botnets can be crippling to individual businesses, cloud services, and the enterprise at large. \t Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update addresses a critical flaw in the Windows VBScript engine that attackers are using to compromise Windows machines through Internet Explorer.  The patch follows an alarm by researchers at Qihoo 360 Core Security The IE attack, dubbed 'Double Kill', was delivered via Office documents that open a malicious webpage in the background.  In Microsoft hasn't confirmed this is the bug reported by Qihoo 360 Core Security but notes the flaw is being exploited in the wild.  \"In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website,\" Microsoft notes.        \"An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked 'safe for initialization' in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.\" Observed attacks have started with a malicious Word document, which when opened downloads an exploit written in VBScript that's hosted on a webpage, The analysts are also confident the exploit they found is the same as the Double Kill attack Qihoo 360 Core Security reported.  While the zero-day attacks are likely to be the work of state-sponsored attackers, Kaspersky Lab predicts it will become popular with cybercriminals as part of an exploit kit's arsenal for compromising Windows PCs in web-based attacks. That's because the technique allows an attacker to force IE to load and exploit the flaw on an unpatched machine even if victims have set Chrome or Firefox as the default browser. \"Despite a Word document being the initial attack vector, the vulnerability is actually in VBScript, not in Microsoft Word. This is the first time we've seen a URL moniker used to load an IE exploit, and we believe this technique will be used heavily by malware authors in the future. This technique allows one to load and render a web page using the IE engine, even if the default browser on a victim's machine is set to something different,\" the analysts said.  \"We expect this vulnerability to become one of the most exploited in the near future, as it won't be long until exploit kit authors start abusing it in both drive-by via browser and spear-phishing via document campaigns.\" The other vulnerability Microsoft has confirmed is currently being exploited is a Win32k elevation of privilege vulnerability, which is tracked as CVE-2018-8120 and rated as important. \"To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system,\" Microsoft notes.  Microsoft also got around to Microsoft patched a total of 67 vulnerabilities in the May Patch Tuesday update, of which 21 are rated as critical.  Microsoft is being urged to rush out a patch for a bug in Internet Explorer that's being used in attacks. Google denies multiple requests by Microsoft for an extension to Project Zero's 90-day disclose-or-fix deadline. Microsoft misses Google's 90-day deadline, so Google has published details of an exploit mitigation bypass. For the second time in a week, Google reveals another unpatched Windows 10 vulnerability.

The internet was built in a great utopian, engineering vision and it wasn’t built with the idea that people would do things with it.”     We are desperately trying to retrofit security and a lot of people are getting a lot of commercial benefit from that, he said.     “I think the real challenge is to make sure we don’t repeat those mistakes in the future. How do we do the researching now and build the security now to make sure that people don’t look back in 20 years’ time and say that when the IoT explosion happened we hadn’t thought about security?” he asked.     Hannigan said we could amplify the problem we’ve already got by dumping billions of new processes into the network without any care for security.     There is still plenty to do in research, he added, and there is a need to “take some of the responsibility away from the individual. It’s not that individuals don’t need to care about it, but we’ve got to get the right balance between what can be built into hardware security” so we can take away from the individual a lot of the worries about that.     “There’s never been a more exciting time to be doing research in this area, and for that reason there is an opportunity here to get the future right in a way that the past wasn’t,” he concluded. \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

Malware has reappeared in Google Play, the official Android app marketplace, after previously being identified and removed. Uncovered by researchers at Symantec, the malware was bundled inside at least seven different apps. The apps were listed as emoji keyboard additions, space cleaners, calculators, app lockers, and call recorders, but none actually performed the advertised functions, and only existed to serve up malware in the form of adware to drive clicks for illicit profit. The malware has previously appeared in the Play Store, before being removed after Google was alerted to its presence. However, the same malicious code reappeared in the official Android market place again, but with apps featuring slightly different names under the banner of a new publisher. In order to help the apps slip past Google Play security, the malware is configured to wait four hours before starting the malicious activity. This also helps lure the user into a false sense of security about the app, so even if they notice the device acting suspiciously, they might not attribute this to the recently installed application.        Following activation, the malware looks to consolidate its position on the device by asking for administrator privileges in order to carry out its activity and make it more difficult for the app to be removed. In order for the request to look convincing, the attackers use an official Google Play icon when asking for administrator privileges.  The malware using Google imagery to ask for admin rights.The goal of the malware is to deliver adware, browsers are also forced to repeatedly open scam pages featuring fake 'you won' notifications which when clicked deliver profit to the attackers. ZDNet has approached Google for comment on how the apps were allowed to enter the Play Store after being previously identified as malware, but hasn't received a response at the time of writing. Researchers at Symantec have also identified a further 38 malicious apps which entered the Google Play store for the first time in December. The apps claim to be games and education apps, but don't really have the functions they promise to provide. Instead, they forcibly redirect users to install another app from the Play Store called 'Change My Voice' which does have some functionality and also displays lots of adverts -- once again used to drive click-based revenue. At least 10,000 users in US, UK, South Africa, India, Japan, Egypt, Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden downloaded this malware before it was removed from the Play Store after Symantec informed Google. In order to remain protected against Android malware, researchers recommend keeping software up-to-date and to pay close attention to permissions requested by apps, especially unfamiliar or unusual ones. A recent report by Google said the company However, with a large userbase, even a small percentage of malicious apps slipping through the net could result in millions of devices inadvertently being compromised.  US deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein charges nine Iranian hackers with cyber crimes in March 2018. (Image: file photo)  Iran is likely to respond with cyberattacks against Western businesses in response to the Trump administration's withdrawal from the nuclear deal, cybersecurity experts say.  Research out Wednesday suggests attacks could come \"within months, if not faster,\" according to security firm Recorded Future.  The research paints a detailed picture of how Iran uses contractors and universities to staff its offensive cybersecurity operations -- or hacking efforts -- against foreign targets. A former insider with knowledge of Iran's hacking operations said the attacks are likely to be launched by contractors and thus pose a greater risk of spinning out of control.  On Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced the US would Although there has been no evidence or intelligence to suggest a cyberattack is in the works, researchers say they predict, based on Iran's  \"We assess that within months, if not sooner, American companies in the financial, critical infrastructure, oil, and energy sectors will likely face aggressive and destructive cyberattacks by Iranian state-sponsored actors,\" said Priscilla Moriuchi, a former NSA analyst, now at Recorded Future.        \"The Islamic Republic may utilize contractors that are less politically and ideologically reliable -- and trusted -- and as a result, could be more difficult to control,\" she said.  Countries allied  Levi Gundert, who co-authored the research, told Much of the research is centered on Iran's long-known history of targeting Western businesses and governments with cyberattacks  Tehran began strengthening its cyber capabilities following the Green Revolution, a period of intense protests in Iran against the incumbent government during the Arab Spring in 2009.  The government responded with a heavy crackdown, with an increased focus on cyber operations.  But some of the best hackers available were primarily young and financially driven, said the report. This led to mistrust and fears that the hackers could be bought by foreign intelligence agencies.  According to the former insider, that led to a tiered trust system that centered Tehran's hacking efforts around a central team of trusted and ideologically aligned middle management that dishes out assignments to contractors -- often pitting teams against each other -- who get paid only when the work is completed. The government also uses compartmentalization -- giving one team an infiltration mission and using another to launch a remote code execution attack.  It's estimated that at least 50 organizations are competing for government hacking work, the research said, including contractors and universities to conduct hacking operations.  One such institution, Imam Hossein University, was  But because some of Iran's best operators \"are not always the most devout or loyal to the regime,\" the researchers warn they \"could be more difficult to control.\" That may lead to the IRGC choosing a less ideologically driven contractor, capable of delivering a destructive attack in a short period of time, instead of a trusted and less politically driven contractor.  \"It is possible that this dynamic could limit the ability of the government to control the scope and scale of these destructive attacks once they are unleashed,\" the researchers said.  Recorded Future isn't the only company warning of incoming Tehran-backed cyberattacks.  Security firm FireEye warned that Iranian hackers were \"probing Western critical infrastructure in multiple industries for future attack.\"  \"These efforts did not entirely disappear with the agreement, but they did refocus on Iran's neighbors in the Middle East,\" said John Hultquist, FireEye's director of intelligence analysis, in an email to  \"With the dissolution of the agreement, we anticipate that Iranian cyberattacks will once again threaten Western critical infrastructure,\" he said.

They all have experienced high-value web-app attacks.  A new study released by Arxan, The study of nearly 1,400 IT and IT security practitioners across the US, EU and APAC indicates that effective app visibility to stop attacks is still lacking and that the motivator for improved app protection comes after the damage is done – loss of productivity, customer trust and revenue.   It's loss, not prevention, that continues to drive investment in application security. As application breaches continue to rise, so do the security risks of running business-critical apps in zero-trust environments.  The majority of organizations (75%) that participated in the study reported that they likely, most likely or definitely experienced a material cyber-attack or data breach within the last year due to a compromised application. More than half (54%) of respondents expect to see a significant increase in threats in 2018, and 64% of respondents are concerned that they will be hacked through an application.   “This is a big deal, it’s not pocket change. The average data breach costs almost $4 million when you include lost customers, the impact to operations, and your insurance costs going up,” said Rusty Carter, vice president of product management, Arxan. “Companies have to change the way they think about investing in app security because threats are only getting worse.”  Despite the anticipation of increased risk, only 25% of respondents report making significant investment in solutions to prevent application attacks, likely because 48% of respondents believe that app performance and speed are more important than security.   The findings in this study points to two struggles companies have faced for some time. \"Giving organizations the visibility into the security posture of their deployed applications allows them to optimize their security and customer experience,\" said Carter. \"Yet security professionals lack an awareness about the status of their app's security.\"   As a result, \"they will be ineffective at responding to attacks before they lead to full-blown breaches,\" said Carter.  \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

Addressing the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth on Thursday, DHA representatives discussed its desired single \"touch point\" approach to managing trade, saying it was looking to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for a suitable framework. \"The majority of traders are trusted and interact in a secure and transparent supply chain,\" a department spokesperson said. \"Intelligence and risk assessment capabilities and revenue collection are improved by new and emerging technologies, such as blockchain, that would improve the veracity, validation, and analysis of intelligence and trade data.\"                      You can read this executive guide as a PDF (free registration required).                                           In exploring \"new and innovative ways\" digital technology can be used to facilitate legitimate trade, DHA said it is continually assessing the applicability of new technologies as they mature. \"Increasingly, technology development builds upon existing and more mature fundamental building blocks including: The IoT, cloud computing, data analytics, and AI,\" the department wrote in its \"This set of technologies forms an ecosystem in which each technology both exploits and fosters the development of the others.\" A specific example DHA highlights as being easily integrated into a trade ecosystem is blockchain.       Trade information required by governments for border clearance purposes is created by industry operators in the international supply chain, and Home Affairs is assessing how it could leverage information that might be held on a trade blockchain.  \"We may not need to develop discrete new border management/import/export systems, but rather leverage the pertinent information captured by industry. Home Affairs would use the information in conjunction with other processes (e.g. risk assessment) to manage the clearance of goods,\" the department's submission continues.  \"It will also provide visibility of goods as they advance through the supply chain,\" it added. \"Blockchain is intended to give real time visibility, significantly improving the information available for risk analysis and targeting, which may eventually lead to increased safety and security as well as greater efficiency in border inspection clearance procedures.\"  Additionally, DHA said blockchain could make it faster to process transactions, and support the formation of new transactional relationships. The committee also heard on Thursday that although still a nascent technology, Home Affairs is researching, investigating, and understanding how industry is leveraging blockchain to build or contribute to its trade modernisation agenda. \"Blockchain is a tool, the information -- it gives you greater visibility of who entered data into the system,\" a DHA representative said on Thursday. \"Garbage in, garbage out; if somebody is intentionally trying to misrepresent the information it will still go into or be captured in a blockchain. What blockchain does provide -- it's a public ledger, a distributed ledger, all stakeholders in the ecosystem will have visibility of that information where it's appropriate.\" Currently, DHA is drip-fed information on trade by other government entities and the private sector, and places it into a centralised depository Home Affairs has.  The trade modernisation plan would see a \"single window\" for all relevant regulatory and transactional information. \"As they emerge, we will use new technologies to better analyse and assess trade data to ensure a more secure border. We will do this while ensuring the threat of cyber incursion of Australian business, as well as government, and of organised crime is managed,\" the department wrote in its submission. \"We recognise that the strategic use of technology will allow us to put in place more efficient business processes, as well as enhancing our capabilities in the important areas of intelligence collection and risk assessment.\" The department said it will also be \"adaptive and proactive\" in the face of future cybersecurity challenges and will, along with Australian business and individuals, play a \"critical role in protecting the community from the threats inherent in a digital trading economy\".   \tDespite the existence of  \tResponding to a Question on Notice by Liberal Senator Linda Reynolds from Senate Estimates, ASD said it did not agree with an assertion that its role should be diminished in keeping government clouds secure.  \t\"ASD is not scaling back on its cloud certification and supporting industry partnerships role,\" the directorate said. \"ASD will continue to assist cloud providers in securing government (and our nation's) information.\"  \tSimply throwing more resources at the certification problem was not a complete solution, ASD said, with agency heads needing to be able to identify and manage cybersecurity risks.  \t\"ASD is best placed to certify cloud services through strong partnerships with industry, using ASD endorsed Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) Assessors,\" it said.         \t\"Agencies remain risk owners and must conduct accreditation of all cloud services, including those certified by ASD. The DTA Secure Cloud Strategy highlighted that agencies can conduct certification activities.\"  \tIn response to a question from Reynolds on whether the DTA had \"deep level cybersecurity experts\", ASD said it \"employs the bulk of government cybersecurity experts\".        \tEarlier this year, DTA's CEO Gavin Slater told Senate Estimates he wants his  \t\"We had a small cybersecurity team embedded within the DTA ... the role of that team was that when agencies were thinking about transforming the way their services are delivered digitally was to really ensure they were thinking about security not as an afterthought but part of the key design criterion -- that was the primary role of that team,\" Slater said in February.  \t\"But recently under a machinery of government change, with the centralisation of the cybersecurity function under Alastair MacGibbon, that team has been mogged out from the DTA.\"  \tSlater said the work the DTA does with agencies is cross-functional, and it is far easier to have people within the DTA, rather than having to ask for access to them in another arm of government.  \tThe DTA's Secure Cloud Strategy pushed government agencies to use public cloud by default, and asked agencies to make risk-based decisions when applying cloud security; design services only for the cloud and avoid customisation; use as much of the cloud as possible; take full advantage of cloud automation practices; and monitor the health and usage of cloud services in real time.  \t\"Agencies must design all new or modernised ICT services as cloud native, or cloud-enabled,\" the strategy said. Speaking in March, ASD director-general Mike Burgess said a \"Skilled people is not the critical issue here, it's the skill of the  chief executive and his/her management team in identifying and managing  this risk effectively and the skilled executive level that can actually  work through that to ensure themselves the right thing is being done --  that for me is the real issue, not the skills shortage of bright young  ladies or men who know how to configure firewalls or set up systems  securely,\" Burgess explained. \"There's a demand for good IT  people, absolutely, that's not the problem here; the problem is having  the chief executives asking the right questions. \"That's not a cybersecurity skills shortage.\" Appearing before the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth on Thursday, MacGibbon said the ASD under the leadership of Burgess will \"increasingly be advising agencies where we believe they are deficient in their security\". The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit wants the government to include the additional four steps in its list of mandatory infosec strategies. Mike Pezzullo's apparent thought bubble on domestic digital surveillance has been burst, but it foreshadows tense times ahead for Australia's new domestic security arrangements. Microsoft has received accreditation from the Australian Signals Directorate, allowing it to store highly classified government information up to 'protected' level on its Office 365 platform and specific Azure services. The Australian Signals Directorate's newly minted director has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity skills shortage, highlighting rather there's a need to ensure the people at the top of government departments are aware of the threats they face.

According to In an email toAs an example, he pointed to the fact that Oracle still does quarterly patches, which was a challenge until he worked at a software company “that had tons of stuff built on Oracle.”  He said: “It turns out that you must do QA/integration testing on all those patches before rolling out because they almost always break functionality. This is still current practice with Oracle patches.”  Respondents to the survey were also asked if security testing is conducted on their enterprises systems, which revealed that 7% fail to conduct any security testing whatsoever. However, 79% said that they do carry out testing, with 68% using the services of penetration testers.  Bob Egner, VP at Outpost24, said: “To maximize the value of testing investment, remediation action should be taken as close to the time of testing as possible. The proliferation of connected technologies, the knowledge and resource gap continue to be key challenges. Security staff can easily become overwhelmed and lose focus on the remediation that can be most impactful to the business.”  Tomhave said that another consideration is DevOps; specifically, the cultural change that facilitates continuous integration and development pipelines and heavy automation.   “The answer for production servers is to be able to automate integration and testing, as well as the ability to do A/B (or green/blue) deployments where you automatically patch a golden image, then push it out through the automated integration, build, and deployment process to ramp up new resources, or rapidly flag it back to dev to fix specific integration issues,” he said.  “As such, automation is part of the answer, but again really just as it applies to servers. For user endpoints, mobile devices, and IoT, almost certainly that should all be automated and pushed asap (provided there's a rollback option).”  Marten Mickos, CEO of Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

Along with the threats surrounding the huge number of global connected devices, O’Neill also pointed to counterfeit devices, untrusted supply chains, hardware trojans and vulnerabilities affecting hardware devices as factors that are increasing the risks of insecure IoT/connected products.     In terms of the challenges in securing connected devices and making them trustworthy, she cited the following as key:        The answer lies in a need for hardware security, O’Neill said, with a multi-layered approach, establishing a trusted computing baseline that anchors trust in tamper-proof hardware.     To address the issue, RISE was set up with the followings aims/visions:     Mozilla has released Firefox 60 with support for a new option to sign in to websites without using a password.  That's thanks to an emerging W3C standard called By removing passwords, the WebAuthn API will make phishing attacks a lot harder and gives users more convenient authentication choices, including A key advantage, like the FIDO Alliance's predecessor U2F standard for security keys, is that WebAuthn generates cryptographic public-private pairs for signing in, which means no shared secrets that could be leaked if a site is hacked.          Though the standard is currently only rolling out to desktop browsers, in future mobile browsers are likely to support it too.  Beyond signing into websites, WebAuthn combined with another WC3 standard in development, But as it stands, Firefox for the desktop is the first browser to support WebAuthn. Aligning with Firefox 60's WebAuthn support, Dropbox Dropbox has supported U2F since 2015 but only allowed secure sign-in to Dropbox from Chrome. Dropbox sees potential in WebAuthn because it will allow secure sign-in from more browsers and eventually more devices.          However, for now, Dropbox and Firefox support for WebAuthn doesn't entirely remove the need for passwords and currently serves as a means of more broadly supporting two-factor authentication.  Also arriving with Firefox 60 is Mozilla's new money-making scheme \"sponsored stories\", courtesy of its acquisition of the read-it-later service, Pocket.

Finally, Mozilla has released Firefox Quantum for Enterprise, Organizations can choose the standard Firefox Rapid Release with new features every six weeks or the slower Extended Support Release, which is updated annually.  Browser makers take an important step in reducing the need for passwords and all the security threats they bring. Firefox users will soon start to see sponsored stories in new tabs, but Mozilla says it will respect users' privacy.

When the Washington police opened solicitations, the only bidder, Draeger, a German medical technology maker, won the contract to sell its flagship device, the Alcotest 9510, across the state.  \t \tBut defense attorneys have long believed the breathalyzer is faulty.         \t \tJason Lantz, a Washington-based defense lawyer, enlisted a software engineer and a security researcher to examine its source code. The two experts wrote in a preliminary report that they found flaws capable of producing incorrect breath test results. The defense hailed the results as a breakthrough, believing the findings could cast doubt on countless drunk-driving prosecutions.  \t \tThe two distributed their early findings to attendees at a conference for defense lawyers, which Draeger said was in violation of a court-signed protective order the experts had agreed to, and the company threatened to sue.        \t \tTheir research was left unfinished, and a final report was never completed.  \t \tDraeger said in a statement the company was protecting its source code and intellectual property, not muzzling research.  \t \t\"Pursuant to a protective order, Draeger provided the source code to both of the defense experts in Snohomish County,\" said Marion Varec, a spokesperson for Draeger. \"That source code is highly proprietary and it was important to Draeger that the protective order limit its use to the purposes of the litigation at issue.\" Draeger says it believes that one of the experts entrusted to examine the source code was using it in violation of the protective order, so Draeger sent the expert a cease and desist letter. Draeger says it \"worked with the expert to resolve the issue.\"  \t \tOf the law firms we spoke to that were at the conference and received the report, none knew of Draeger's threat to launch legal action. A person with a copy of the report allowed  \t \tThe breathalyzer has become a staple in law enforcement, with more than a million Americans arrested each year for driving under the influence of alcohol -- an offense known as a DUI. Drunk driving has its own economy: A multi-billion dollar business for lawyers, state governments, and the breathalyzer manufacturers -- all of which have a commercial stake at play.  \t \tYet, the case in Washington is only the latest in several legal battles where the breathalyzer has faced scrutiny about the technology used to secure convictions.  \t \tWhen one Washington state driver accused of drunk-driving in 2015 disputed the reading, his defense counsel petitioned the court to obtain the device's source code from Draeger.  \t \tLantz, who was leading the legal effort to review the Alcotest 9510 in the state, hired two software engineers, Falcon Momot, a security consultant, and Robert Walker, a software engineer and decade-long Microsoft veteran, who were tasked with examining the code. The code was obtained under a court-signed protective order, putting strict controls on Momot and Walker to protect the source code, though the order permitted the researchers to report their findings, with some limitations. Although the researchers were not given a device, the researchers were given a binary file containing the state's configuration set by Washington State Patrol.  \t \tAlthough their findings had yet to be verified against one of the breathalyzers, their preliminary report outlined several issues in the code that they said could impact the outcome of an alcohol breath test. A Draeger Alcotest 9510 device, with a reading in German. (Image:    \tIn order to produce a result, the Alcotest 9510 uses two sensors to measure alcohol content in a breath sample: An infrared beam that measures how much light goes through the breath, and a fuel cell that measures the electrical current of the sample. The results should be about the same and within a small margin of error -- usually within a thousandth of a decimal point. If the results are too far apart, the test will be rejected.   \tBut the report said that under some conditions the breathalyzer can return an inflated reading -- a result that could also push a person over the legal limit.   \tOne attorney, who read the report, said they believed the report showed the breathalyzer \"tipped the scales\" in favor of prosecutors, and against drivers.   \tOne section in the report raised issue with a lack of adjustment of a person's breath temperature.   \tBreath temperature can fluctuate throughout the day, but, according to the report, can also wildly change the results of an alcohol breath test. Without correction, a single digit over a normal breath temperature of 34 degrees centigrade can inflate the results by six percent -- enough to push a person over the limit.   \tThe quadratic formula set by the Washington State Patrol should correct the breath temperature to prevent false results. The quadratic formula corrects warmer breath downward, said the report, but the code doesn't explain how the corrections are made. The corrections \"may be insufficient\" if the formula is faulty, the report added.   \tIssues with the code notwithstanding, Washington chose not to install a component to measure breath temperature, according to testimony in a 2015 hearing, and later confirmed by Draeger.   \tKyle Moore, a spokesperson for Washington State Patrol said the police department \"tested and approved the instrument that best fit our business needs,\" and believes the device can produce accurate results without the breath temperature sensor.   \tThe code is also meant to check to ensure the device is operating within a certain temperature range set by Draeger, because the device can produce incorrect results if it's too hot or too cold.   \tBut the report said a check meant to measure the ambient temperature was disabled in the state configuration.   \t\"The unit could record a result even when outside of its operational requirements,\" said the report. If the breathalyzer was too warm, the printed-out results would give no indication the test might be invalid, the report said.   \tDraeger disputed this finding. A spokesperson said the Washington devices check their temperature, the check is enabled, and that the devices will not produce a reading while the device is outside its operational temperature range.   \tWhen asked, a Washington State Patrol spokesperson would not say if the breathalyzer was configured to allow breath tests outside its operational temperature range, saying only that the device \"has been tested and validated in various ambient temperatures.\"   \tThe report also scrutinized the other sensor -- the fuel cell -- used to measure a person's alcohol levels. Any fuel cell will degrade over time -- more so when the breathalyzer is used often. This decay can alter the accuracy of test results. The code is meant to adjust the results to balance out the fuel cell's decline, but the report said the correction is flawed. Breathalyzers should be re-calibrated every year, but the state's configuration limits those adjustments only to the first six months, the report added.   \t\"We also note that the calibration age does not account for the use frequency of conditions; a unit that has been used hundreds of times per day would have the same correction as one used only once or twice in several months,\" the report said.   \tConcluding the nine-page report, the researchers say they are \"skeptical\" that the Alcotest 9510 can produce a reliable measurement of breath alcohol.   \t\"Although the apparatus states its output in very absolute terms, we recommend interpreting the results with extreme caution,\" the report said.   \tAlthough Momot and Walker's code review was limited to devices in Washington, similar concerns dragged other states into protracted legal battles, forcing prosecutors to defend not only the breathalyzer but also how it's configured.   \tBut the line between Draeger's source code and each state's configuration is blurry, making it difficult to know who is responsible for incorrect results.   \tDraeger said in an email that the \"calibration and adjustment procedures depend on the instrument, additional equipment and materials, and the persons performing these procedures.\" When asked about the guardrails put in place to prevent calibration errors, the company said, \"only trained and certified personnel perform special instrument certification procedures.\"   \tWashington State Patrol said the device produces accurate results, even without certain sensors installed.                       If source code gets into the wrong hands, the damage would be incalculable.                                             \tDraeger's breathalyzer is widely used across the US, including in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. It's often the only breathalyzer used in the states where they were bought.   \tIn both New Jersey and Massachusetts, defense lawyers raised concerns. By acquiring the devices used by the states, lawyers commissioned engineers to analyze the code who say they found flaws that they say could produce incorrect results.   \tBut defense teams in both states largely failed to stop their state governments from using the devices, public records show.   \tNew Jersey's top court found in 2008 that a similar Alcotest breathalyzer -- said to use the same underlying algorithms as the Alcotest 9510 -- was \"generally scientifically reliable\" and can be used with some configuration changes. One such change   \tThe same court ruled five years later that the breathalyzer \"remains scientifically reliable, and generates results that are admissible\" in court.   \tIn nearby Massachusetts, a scandal that blew up in 2017 involving alleged failings in the breathalyzer   \tA district judge ruled that breath test results from miscalibrated devices for two years prior to September 2014 were \"presumptively unreliable,\" said Joe Bernard, a defense attorney who led the case against the Alcotest 9510 in Massachusetts.   \tBernard, and his colleague Tom Workman, a computer forensic expert who later trained as a lawyer and consulted on the case, obtained the state's source code and produced a report.   \tIn a phone call, Workman criticized the Draeger breathalyzer, arguing that it can produce widely inflated results. One section of his report claimed the device had a litany of programming errors, including code that -- like in Washington -- apparently fails to correct for fuel cell fatigue.   \tBut the court rejected the findings and found the source code still produced sound scientific results.   \tWhile legal battles were ongoing, Washington waited to push ahead with its deployment, but the   \tAlmost a year later, Washington State Patrol's toxicologist said in an email  seen by   \tWhen asked whether an independent evaluation was ever commissioned, a Washington State Patrol spokesperson would not comment further and referred back to the legal filings in the case.   \tA later email in 2015 confirmed that the Washington State Patrol was \"never commissioned.\"   \tMoses Garcia, a former Washington state prosecutor who now works for a non-profit providing local governments in the state with legal advice, said in an email that the earlier breathalyzer in the New Jersey case had already been deemed admissible, and that the newer Alcotest 9510 uses the \"same basic algorithms and formulas\" as its predecessor.   \tThe former prosecutor criticized the defense's discovery effort as \"speculation.\"   \t\"In adopting and approving the [Alcotest 9510], the Washington breath alcohol program exceeds, by far, the scientific standards accepted in the scientific community for breath test instrument validation,\" he said.   \tFive years after the contract was signed, Washington State Patrol began deploying hundreds of Draeger breathalyzers in 2014 -- sparking interest from defense attorneys in the state.   \tNot long after, defense attorneys in the state sought access to the devices.   \tLantz was granted access to the source code used for Momot and Walker's code review by a local county court. In one of several recent phone calls with   \t\"We thought we would find something but nothing like this,\" he said.   \tHundreds of DUI lawyers descended on Las Vegas in mid-2017 for their annual gathering.   \tAt the event, the two researchers shared their findings, which claimed the Alcotest 9510 having a \"defective design.\"   \tWord spread quickly. Draeger sent the researchers a cease and desist letter claiming defamation and alleging the two violated a protective order, designed to protect the source code from leaking.   \tDraeger and the researchers settled before a case was filed in court, avoiding any protracted legal battle. A legal case disputing the fine print of the order could have taken years to resolve.   \tDraeger said it \"remains willing to provide the source code for use in other litigation in Washington, so long as a proper protective order is in place.\"   \tBeyond a   \tThe statement said that the two experts \"never intended to violate the protective order\" and denied any wrongdoing. But the two sides \"agree\" the draft report was based on incomplete data and not finished -- and that \"no one in possession of the report should rely on it for any purpose.\"   \tWe reached out to Walker with questions, but he referred only to the settlement statement on his company's website, and he declined to comment further.    \tDraeger would not say why the settlement did not include a retraction on the report's findings.   \t\"There has not been an evidentiary hearing in Washington. If and when there is one, Draeger will cooperate fully,\" a spokesperson said.   \tBut Lantz paints a different picture. The defense attorney said he believes there \"really was no technical violation of the protective order,\" because the report didn't disclose any source code.   \t\"I do believe that [Draeger] is trying to interpret the protective order to be something that it's not,\" he said. \"If we could go back in time, I would've asked that the report was not handed out -- just because of the optics of it.\"   \tLantz said the protective order is vague, but contends it was framed to prevent the researchers from using the source code or their findings for commercial gain -- effectively preventing Momot and Walker from using their knowledge to build their own competing devices. He believes the order gives Draeger near complete control over the code and anything the company deems \"protected\" information.   \tThat's when Draeger \"began developing a strategy on how to block\" the researchers' report, said Lantz, because the company didn't want the \"pervasive exposure of these flaws.\"   \t\"I believe that interest of Draeger's to protect their bottom line overlaps with the state's interest to keep juries from hearing this information about the problems,\" he said.   \tDraeger maintained that it is protecting its intellectual property. The company said in response that it \"takes very seriously the proprietary nature of its source code,\" and \"protects proprietary information as a sound business practice,\" which can include various types of communications or agreements for a particular matter.   \tMomot and Walker are no longer involved with the case, but Sam Felton, a Washington-based software engineer, is set to conduct another review of the Alcotest 9510 code. When contacted, Felton would not speak in specifics about his findings to date, citing his own protective order, except that he found things in the code that caused him \"to have concerns.\"   \tAnd Lantz, now at a new law firm, is working on starting discovery proceedings in neighboring King County, home of Seattle, the largest city in the state.

Since the ransomware attack that impacted an estimated 200,000 computers, new research suggests that organizations across the UK are still struggling to deal with ransomware, none more than those in the healthcare industry.  Over 400 IT decision makers at UK businesses partook in a recently released That number could indicate a false sense of security, given that 45% of respondents had suffered a ransomware attack. Of those, nearly a quarter (23%) actually paying the ransom. More than half of the healthcare companies polled (52%) admitting to having suffered an attack.  “Organizations still aren’t investing the necessary time and resources in risk mitigation and recovery processes, leaving them with limited options in case of a successful attack. The healthcare industry in particular needs to be very aware of the fact that it is a high-profile target, with valuable data at stake, and take special care to ensure that defenses are in place,” said David Kennerley, director of threat research, Webroot.  In the healthcare sector, multiple attacks hit over one in four (26%) organizations. Of the 400 survey participants, 56% of respondents would consider paying the ransom. That number is smaller for organizations in the healthcare sector, with only 34% saying they would consider paying. Interestingly, only 5% of all those surveyed have stocked Bitcoin should they need to pay a ransom. However, 8% of organizations in the healthcare sector have acquired cryptocurrency.  “A ransomware attack should be a blip on the radar that wastes people’s time to restore from backups, not a week-long debacle of trying to restore service and deciding whether to pay the ransom or not,” said Mounir Hahad, head of Juniper Threat Labs at Juniper Networks.  While backing up critical data and testing backups regularly has been advised as a way to mitigate the risks of a ransomware attack, 36% of survey respondents don’t have a regular backup system. That decreases to 32% when looking solely at the healthcare industry.  Addressing the human factor seems to be one step that many companies have taken to mitigate risk. Kennerley noted that when organizations invest in security awareness training with phishing simulation tools, they are less likely to suffer from attacks than those who don’t invest in employee education. Fewer than half of the respondents (46% overall, 42% in healthcare) reported that they have not held staff training on ransomware. \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

It’s hardly a secret that there are weaknesses in the digital systems of several federal agencies, which is why Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Ted Yoho (R.

The code, discovered and confirmed by Flashpoint researchers, has been released to the public through a Russian-speaking online forum.  The same threat actor has also leaked the malware's GPU builder and administrator panel, which when compiled, offers those without specialized knowledge the opportunity to wreak havoc on target PoS systems.    This stolen information may then be used to create clone cards and customer records stolen from PoS terminals may also be sold on for the purposes of identity theft.          In the cases of  On Thursday, Flashpoint The malware family has been on the radar since 2014. The original developer appears to be a Russian speaker with proficiency in the English language who developed TreasureHunter for the underground dump seller BearsInc.  According to a TreasureHunter is a typical PoS malware variant. The malware targets Windows-based servers and PoS terminals, and once infected and executed, creates a registry which launches the malware at startup.   The malicious code then scans PoS devices for track data and credit card information. These records are then collected and sent to a CC server.  It is not known why the source code has been leaked. It may be that the operator is leaving the PoS criminal world and is washing their hands of their creation, or it could be that a new-and-improved PoS malware is in development.    \"In the past, malware source code leaks such as the Zeus banking Trojan have spawned numerous variants, including Citadel, which cost organizations hundreds of millions in losses,\" the researchers note. \"PoS malware leaks have had similar effects, most notably with the 2015 leak of the Alina malware which led to the creation of the ProPoS and Katrina variants.\" The source code is available and therefore can be customized by users for their own ends -- potentially leading to an influx of new PoS malware variants.  One silver lining, however, is that security researchers can also plunder the code for insight into the PoS malware industry and use this knowledge to improve cybersecurity solutions for individuals and businesses alike.  \t\t A new malware campaign has been uncovered on Facebook which not only steals account credentials but also installs scripts for covert cryptocurrency mining. \tCybersecurity firm Radware \tThe malware is so called due to the abuse of a legitimate Google Chrome extension called \"\tNigelthorn was discovered in May this year and has infected over 100,000 Facebook users in over 100 countries to date. \tAccording to Radware researchers, the Nigelthorn campaign is propagating across the social network through social engineering and private messages and aims to dupe users into downloading malware for the purpose of account hijacking, cryptojacking, and click fraud.        \tPotential victims will see a message from a connection in their network which tags them in a post or will receive private messages which alternatively contain a malicious link or picture. \tIf a victim clicks through, the malicious link redirects victims to a fake YouTube page which requests that users install a Google Chrome extension in order to play video content.  In order to bypass Google's validation checks, the threat actor responsible creates copies of legitimate extensions and inject short, obfuscated, malicious scripts within them. Once a user accepts the \"Add Extension\" request, a malicious extension is installed and the victim's system is added to a botnet. These malicious extensions also redirect the victim to Facebook in order to generate a session token and hijack their online session in order to slurp up their Facebook account credentials and send them to command-and-control (CC) server.  This access also permits the malware to send messages in their stead and propagate further.  \tNigelthorn is also capable of stealing Instagram cookies if they are found. \tOnce the malicious extension is installed on the Google Chrome browser, malicious JavaScript comes into play. The script is downloaded from the CC server and further installs a cryptomining tool. \tThis tool forces the victim's machine to covertly mine for cryptocurrencies, of which the proceeds are sent to mining pools controlled by the attacker.  Radware says that in the last few days, Monero, Bytecoin, and Electroneum are the mining targets and the attackers have made roughly $1,000. \tNigelthorn employs a number of techniques in order to retain persistency on the victim's machine. If a victim tries to open the extensions tab, the malware automatically closes it. The malware also blocks users from downloading Facebook and Chrome cleaner tools, deleting Facebook posts, and making comments. \tWhile malicious copies of Nigelify are responsible for the majority of infections, the researchers have also discovered other legitimate extensions which have been abused including PwnerLike and iHabno. \tFour other extensions were detected by Google's security systems and were removed in less than 24 hours. \tThe majority of infections have taken place in the Philippines, Venezuela, and Ecuador. \t \t\"The malware depends on Chrome and runs on both Windows and Linux,\" the researchers say. \"It is important to emphasize that the campaign focuses on Chrome browsers and Radware believes that users that do not use Chrome are not at risk.\" \tA Google spokesperson Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

The layout of the The contents are largely unchanged, but rather than using text-heavy chapters with descriptions and bullet points, the new policy leads with a list of content categories that can be clicked to hop to each section of the policy.              Each section of the policy now includes illustrations or short YouTube videos that explain in simple language what the policy means and what devices and services it covers, including Android, Chrome, Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Home.   The purpose of the redesign is to make it easier for users to find information about what information Google collects and understand why it does it. It also offers links within the policy that lead to privacy settings.        \"We've improved the navigation and organization of the policy to make it easier to find what you're looking for; explained our practices in more detail and with clearer language; and added more detail about the options you have to manage, export, and delete data from our services,\" William Malcolm, director of privacy legal at Google EMEA, Google will also be emailing all its users to inform them about the new policy, meaning billions of people are set to receive the notification.  Another part of Google's GDPR compliance effort focuses on data portability. To support this issue, Google recently released the \"Data Transfer Project envisions an ecosystem of adapters that convert a range of proprietary formats into a small number of canonical formats useful for transferring data,\" Google \"This allows data transfer between any two service providers using the service provider's existing authorization mechanism, and allows each service provider to maintain control over the security of their service.\" To encourage service providers to adopt the technology, the project draws a distinction between a user's data and a service provider's data.  \"Portability should not extend to data collected to make a service operate, including data generated to improve system performance or train models that may be commercially sensitive or proprietary.\" Finally, Google is rolling out its Family Link Android app to all countries within the EU. Until now the Family Link service The app lets parents create a Google Account for their child's Android device and manage what apps their children can use.   \"Under the new rules, companies must get consent from parents to process their children's data in certain circumstances,\" notes Malcolm.

Microsoft has heavily promoted the advances it's made in Windows 10's built-in exploit mitigations to encourage enterprise adoption, but Google's Project Zero isn't convinced key defenses can stand up to advanced hackers.  Project Zero researcher Ivan Fratric has released a Currently ACG exploit mitigation is exclusive to Edge and aims to prevent advanced attackers from executing malicious code in memory if they've already compromised a content process in the browser. Fratric in February The bypass undermined -- and helped Microsoft improve -- a customization Microsoft developed to ensure Edge's Just in Time (JIT) JavaScript compilers worked with ACG enabled.  The solution required considerable effort on Microsoft's part and involved putting Edge's JIT engine in its own sandboxed process, separate from the browser's content processes.  The defense should ultimately stop advanced attackers escaping Edge's sandbox. However,  Fratric found that while ACG generally stands up to the task, it and another feature called Code Integrity Guard, are let down by a further Windows 10 exploit mitigation feature called Control Flow Guard (CFG).  Fratric contends that for ACG to be successful at blocking all attacks, ACG, CIG and CFG all need to be impervious to bypasses. But that's not the case with CFG, and in some attack scenarios Chrome's site-isolation feature would be harder to bypass than Edge with ACG enabled, according to Fratric.  \"Currently, He continues later: \"ACG does succeed to fulfill its purpose of preventing executable memory from being allocated and modified. However, due to mutual dependence of CFG, ACG and CIG and the shortcomings of CFG in Microsoft Windows, ACG alone can't be sufficient to stop advanced attackers from escaping a browser's sandbox and mounting other attacks.\"  Google's Chrome developers see site-isolation, which involves running each site in its own sandboxed process, as the However, overall Fratric believes that Microsoft's customizations that enabled ACG for Edge are inherently flawed.  \"While the paper focuses on Microsoft Edge, we believe that any other attempt to implement out-of-process JIT would encounter similar problems,\" Fratric ZDNet has contacted Microsoft for its comments and will post its response should one be received.

Hence the malware has been dubbed Nigelthorn.   \"The original Nigelify application replaces pictures to 'Nigel Thornberry' and is responsible for a large portion of the observed infections,\" the researchers wrote in a RadwareThe malware has been known since March 2018. Malicious actors have socially engineered links on Facebook so that when users click on the link, they are redirected to a fake YouTube page. Rather than watching the video they expect to see, they are asked to install the dubious extension.  The extension then executes a malicious JavaScript code, turning the victim's computer into part of a botnet. In addition to stealing the victim's Facebook and Instagram credentials, the malware also collects data from the user's Facebook account.   \"This stolen information is then used to send malicious links to friends of the infected person in an effort to push the same malicious extensions further. If any of those friends click on the link, the whole infection process starts over again,\" wrote All the while, an additional crypto-mining tool is also downloaded by the malware. While the group has been observed as attempting to mine Electroneum, Bytecoin, and Monero, they've had the greatest success mining from the Monero pool, earning approximately $1,000 in six days.   While Google's security algorithms have blocked four of the seven malicious extensions identified by Radware researchers, attackers remain able to bypass Google's extension validation checks by exploiting Nigelify and PwnerLike.  The Radware researchers wrote, \"Zero-day malware leverages sophisticated evasion techniques that often bypass existing protections that skilled groups study. Nigelify, which Radware identified in a well-protected network, has gone undetected despite several security solutions.\" \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 (Image: file photo) \tA senator is demanding that the FCC investigate why a company, contracted to monitor calls of prison inmates, also allows police to track phones of anyone in the US without a warrant.  \tThe  \tThe report said former Mississippi County sheriff Cory Hutcheson used the service nearly a dozen times to track the phones of other offices, and even targeted a judge.  \tHutcheson has pleaded not guilty to conducting surveillance without court orders.         \tSecurus provides the location-tracking feature for law enforcement and corrections officers, the report said, which helps locate individuals who abscond from justice or are missing.

They will also be able to communicate with other healthcare providers on the clinical status of joint patients via the digital platform.  \tAustralians will be able to opt out of a My Health Record if they choose, and they similarly can opt out of having their data available for secondary use.  \tWhere a health record has been cancelled, the data also becomes unavailable for secondary use.         \tThe  \t33 items comprise the framework, with many requiring the Secondary Use of Data Governance Board to make the final decision on whether a third party can use the data.        \t \tThe board will comprise representatives from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), which is the data custodian for the purposes of the framework; the Australian Digital Health Agency, which will act as the system operator; and representatives from population health/epidemiology, research, health services delivery, technology, data science, data governance and privacy, and consumer advocacy.  \tThere are 18 steps an entity wishing to access the information contained within the My Health Record must follow, including gaining \"ethics approval\" from the AIHW Ethics Committee.  \tThe board will oversee development and operation of all secondary use infrastructure, the framework explains.  \tFor example, the board will use a \"case and precedent\" approach to determine what is \"solely commercial use\" of data.  \tThe board will assess applications primarily based on the use of data, not the user, with the framework explaining the \"safe people\" principle will be applied when reviewing requests for data with respect to the applicant, probing their knowledge, skills, and incentives to store and use the data appropriately.  \tIn order to be granted access to the data, overseas-based applicants must be working in \"collaboration\" with an Australian applicant in respect to the proposed project. They must also demonstrate that the proposed data usage will generate public health benefits for Australians  \tDirect access to or release of My Health Record data is only to the Australian entity, and data released for secondary use is to be stored in a facility within Australia.  \tThe applicant must also be responsible for ensuring they comply with all relevant Australian legislation.  \tThe framework restricts access to de-identified data, noting it cannot be used solely for commercial and non-health-related purposes.  \tThe provision of My Health Record data to insurance agencies will also not be permitted at this stage, while the use of My Health Record data for clinical trials recruitment will not be considered until an explicit consent option is available in the My Health Record access controls.  \t\"There is a need to balance support for the use of the data for beneficial research and public health purposes against the policy of not using the data for solely commercial purposes,\" the framework reads. \"Commercial organisations may propose uses that could be approved so long as it can be demonstrated that the use is consistent with 'research and public health purposes' and is likely to generate public health benefits and/or be in the public interest.\"  \tWith  \tWhere an applicant seeks access to data from another repository such as the Medicare Benefits Schedule or Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule data, they will be referred to the data custodian for those systems.  \tThe framework will be reviewed after two years of operation.  \t \tThe revelation that supposedly anonymous medical data can be re-identified tops off a year of data governance incompetence by the Australian government.

Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has said it has confirmed a set of vulnerabilities that have the potential to reveal the contents of email previously thought to be encrypted with PGP. EFF said in a \"Our advice, which mirrors that of the researchers, is to immediately disable and/or uninstall tools that automatically decrypt PGP-encrypted email,\" EFF said. \"Until the flaws described in the paper are more widely understood and fixed, users should arrange for the use of alternative end-to-end secure channels, such as Signal, and temporarily stop sending and especially reading PGP-encrypted email.\" In a The full details of the flaw are set for release at 7am UTC on Tuesday, which is 3am on the US eastern seaboard, midnight Pacific time, 5pm in Sydney, and 12:30pm in Mumbai. One of the researchers who discovered the exploit The foundation has created guides for disabling PGP in The Attorney-General's Department (AGD) has argued in favour of extending Australia's telecommunications interception laws from telcos to over-the-top providers. Speaking before the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement on Friday, AGD Assistant Secretary Andrew Warnes said this expansion would help combat the \"challenge of encryption\". \"The obligations that sit under the \"So when you now put on an intercept, that communication may be potentially encrypted, and you may not get information back that is in a usable form, or you may get information that takes some time for you to be able to decipher and use, and sometimes in circumstances of urgency. \"That's one of the challenges we're looking at; it's one that government has come out and said that we're actively working towards legislation on.\"        Also speaking during the hearing on Friday was Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) CEO Michael Phelan, who said the process of telco interceptions is becoming increasingly difficult due to new technologies, with 5G mobile networks to make this even harder.       According to Phelan, as of a year ago, around 60 percent of the traffic that law enforcement was dealing with in interception orders was data rather than voice, which he said will only increase when 5G networks arrive. \"When we move to systems like 5G -- 4G is problematic as is, but when you move to 5G, when identifiers don't exist for a device and they use dynamic IP addresses, then it will make it even difficult to use the metadata to track,\" Phelan told the committee. \"It's an evolving issue, so it's not lost upon anybody what we need to do for law enforcement to be able to continue to intercept.\" In a hearing that also included representatives from the Australian Institute of Criminology, Australian Border Force, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, Phelan argued that the legislation needs to be more device-agnostic in order to deal with advances in technology. This is because \"technology goes too quick for us, for the legislation to keep up with\", Phelan said, adding that it is never too early to begin preparing for 5G, with both \"We're coping, but over the horizon it will get worse,\" Phelan said. \"The legislation is still framed around a device and a person, whereas ... we're after parts and pieces of information regardless of the medium over which it travels. So if we want to intercept, what we want to do is have legislation that just says, 'look I want to intercept communications'. \"How those communications travel, what form those communications make, whether they're data, whether they're voice, whether they're on a device or anything, we want the legislation to be technology agnostic.\" In a bid to give additional intercept powers to law enforcement, the While the purpose of the data-retention legislation was to use retained data in an effort to combat national security threats such as terrorism, an AGD report in August revealed that it is During October 13, 2015, to June 30, 2016, the AGD report said illicit drug offences involved 57,166 authorisations to view telco data. This was followed by miscellaneous, homicide, robbery, fraud, theft, and abduction. Terrorism offences ranked below property damage and cybercrime, with 4,454 data retention authorisations made during that period. Vega Stealer malware is at the heart of a new campaign designed to harvest saved financial data from Google Chrome and Firefox browsers. \tWhile the new malware is only being utilized in simplistic and small phishing campaigns at the moment, \tVega Stealer is a variant of \tThe new malware has a subset of the same functionality but has also been upgraded with an arsenal of expanded features, including a new network communication protocol and Firefox stealing functionality. \tVega Stealer is also written in .NET and focuses on the theft of saved credentials and payment information in Google Chrome. These credentials include passwords, saved credit cards, profiles, and cookies.        \tWhen the Firefox browser is in use, the malware harvests specific files -- \"key3.db\" \"key4.db\", \"logins.json\", and \"cookies.sqlite\" -- which store various passwords and keys. \tHowever, Vega Stealer does not wrap up there. The malware also takes a screenshot of the infected machine and scans for any files on the system ending in .doc, .docx, .txt, .rtf, .xls, .xlsx, or .pdf for exfiltration.       \tAccording to the security researchers, the malware is currently being utilized to target businesses in marketing, advertising, public relations, retail, and manufacturing. \tThe phishing campaign designed to propagate the malware, however, is not sophisticated. Emails are sent with subject lines such as \"Online store developer required,\" and while some are targeted and sent to individuals at a business, most messages are sent to distribution lists including \"publicaffairs@\" and \"clientservice@\". \tThe email contains an attachment called \"brief.doc\" in which malicious macros download the Vega Stealer payload. \tThe payload is retrieved in two steps. The document first downloads an obfuscated JScript/PowerShell script which, once executed, creates a second request that pulls the executable payload of Vega Stealer from the threat actor's command-and-control (CC) center. \tThis payload is then saved in the victim's \"Music\" directory with the name \"ljoyoxu.pkzip.\" Once the executable is in place, Vega Stealer automatically executes via the command line in order to begin harvesting information. \t \tProofpoint believes that the document macro and URLs involved in the campaign may point towards the same threat actor responsible for campaigns spreading financial malware. However, such attribution is made tentatively. \"The document macro utilized in this campaign is a commodity macro that we believe is for sale and used by multiple actors, including the threat actor spreading Emotet banking Trojan,\" the researchers say. \"However, the URL patterns from which the macro retrieves the payload are the same as those used by an actor we are tracking who distributes the Ursnif banking Trojan, which often downloads secondary payloads such as Nymaim, Gootkit, or IcedID. As a result, we attribute this campaign to the same actor with medium confidence.\" \tProofpoint says that it remains to be seen whether or not Vega Stealer is simply a tweaked version of August Stealer developed for this specific campaign. However, the team does believe that due to the sophisticated delivery mechanism, Vega Stealer has the potential to evolve into a common threat.

That said, a successful attack on the more vulnerable management systems can cause widespread disruption. This DDoS attack on Danish railways ticketing site can be added to a growing list of such cyber-attacks that include last October’s DDoS attack on the Swedish Railways that took out their train ordering system for two days resulting in travel chaos.     The lessons are clear, Lloyd added; transportation companies and other operators of essential services have to invest in proactive cybersecurity defenses to ensure that their services can stay online and open for business during a cyber-attack.     (Image: ZDNet)  If you booked train tickets for a European getaway in the past few months, you might want to check your bank statements.  Rail Europe, a site used by Americans to buy train tickets in Europe, has revealed a three-month data breach of credit cards and debit cards.  The announcement came  The company said credit card numbers, expiration dates, and card verification codes were stolen -- everything needed by a fraudster to carry out unauthorized purchases. The hackers also stole name, gender, delivery and invoicing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and in some cases usernames and passwords of customers on the website.         Users should change their passwords. If the same username and password set is used on any other site, they should be changed, too.  Rail Europe said it \"replaced and rebuilt\" compromised systems from known-to-be safe code. Although the company didn't say how the hackers breached its systems to install the credit card-skimming code, the letter added that passwords were changed and certificates were renewed following the hack.        It's not known how many customers are affected. California data breach law mandates that any breach affecting more than 500 state residents has to publicly list the breach notification with the state attorney general's office.  A spokesperson for Rail Europe did not return an email with questions sent prior to publication, including how many customers were hit by the breach.  According to the company's website, the site had over five million customers last year.

Organisations which don't report that they've been the victim of cyber crime are putting others at risk of further attacks and are hampering the authorities' ability to fight against hackers, the UK's serious and organised crime unit has warned. The National Crime Agency has issued the warning to businesses as part of its  \"Under-reporting of data breaches continues to erode our ability to make robust assessment of the scale and cost of network intrusions,\" said the report, adding \"many companies are not disclosing data breaches, putting victims at risk\".  According to figures cited by the NCA, only 38 percent of people have confidence that law enforcement can properly respondent to 'cyber-dependent' crime, with the implication that this is partly why victims fail to report they've been hit.  Even when cybercrime is reported, the police may find themselves unable to convict the perpetrators, because \"those that do report may on occasion not be prepared to support prosecution, hampering the ability of law enforcement to act\".         The National Strategic Assessment of Serious and Organised crime suggests that the lack of successful cyber crime reporting means that cyber attackers believe that there's no consequences of their actions.  This perception is also driven along by the courts often handing out lenient sentences to those convicted of hacking, the NCA suggests - although no specific examples of this are provided.        \"Whilst courts acknowledge the seriousness of the crimes committed, the level of sentence passed does not necessarily reflect this seriousness, and can appear low,\" said the report.  According to the report, cyber criminal schemes at all levels continue to pose a threat to the UK, and while many of these groups are operating outside of UK borders, home-grown cyber criminals must not be underestimated.  \"The threat from UK domestic cyber criminals continues to mature, and these domestic actors are capable of damaging attacks,\" the report warns.  Almost all forms of cyber crime are on the rise, but one the National Crime Agency points to as particularly dangerous for UK businesses is the rise of While these attacks take additional time and resources for hackers to successfully carry out, they can be lucrative. Indeed, the F The sheer number of large data breaches is also fuelling an increase in fraud and phishing, as criminals are able to get their hands on sensitive data to help carry out attacks.  The NCA notes that with  However, the report notes that despite there only being weeks to go until GDPR comes into force,  But there's one thing the NCA points to as a certainty - that cybercriminals and crime groups will continue to target the UK. \"The increasing sophistication of crime groups, coupled with the changing nature of their geographical reach, demonstrates more than ever the requirement for an increasingly co-ordinated response,\" said NCA Director General Lynne Owens   \"Working alongside our law enforcement, intelligence and other partners, we are changing the way we operate to ensure the biggest possible impact.

Designed to mine Monero without the user’s knowledge, the Coinhive variant held onto the top spot as the most prevalent malware at a global reach of 16%. \"Cryptoloot – another crypto-mining malware – was close behind with a global reach of 14%,” researchers wrote.  \"With crypto-mining malware’s consistent growth, cyber-criminals are innovating their techniques in order to find new ways to exploit victims’ machines and net more revenue,” Maya Horowitz, threat intelligence group manager at Check Point, The findings likely comes as no surprise, given the recent news that at least seven tech giants Addressing Microsoft Windows Server and Oracle WebLogic, Horowitz said, “It is troubling that so many organizations were impacted by these known vulnerabilities, especially as patches for both have been available for at least 6 months.\"  With the high number of global organizations being targeted by these attacks, Robert Corradini, director of product management at   \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 The Russian Federation Council’s Commission on Protecting State Sovereignty and Preventing Foreign Interference has come out with its latest A new report due out by the end of the month claims that Western states tried to discredit Putin and “divide” his administration, in order to “isolate” him.

(Screenshot: ZDNet. Source: Four of the largest cell giants in the US are selling your real-time location data to a company that you've probably never heard about before. In case you missed it,                      Real-time location data was accessible by police under \"the legal equivalent of a pinky promise,\" said a senator.                                           The story blew up because a former police sheriff snooped on phone location data without a warrant, Yet little is known about how LocationSmart obtained the real-time location data on millions of Americans, how the required consent from cell user owners was obtained, and who else has access to the data. Kevin Bankston, director of New America's Open Technology Institute, explained in a phone call that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act only restricts telecom companies from disclosing data to the government. It doesn't restrict disclosure to other companies, who then may disclose that same data to the government.        He called that loophole \"one of the biggest gaps in US privacy law.\" \"The issue doesn't appear to have been directly litigated before, but because of the way that the law only restricts disclosures by these types of companies to government, my fear is that they would argue that they can do a pass-through arrangement like this,\" he said.       LocationSmart, a California-based technology company, is one of a handful of so-called data aggregators. It The company boasts coverage of 95 percent of the country, thanks to its access to all the major US carriers, including US Cellular, Virgin, Boost, and MetroPCS, as well as Canadian carriers, like Bell, Rogers, and Telus.  \"We utilize the same technology used to enable emergency assistance and this includes cell tower and cell sector location, assisted GPS and cell tower trilateration,\" said a case study on the company's website.  \"With these location sources, we are able to locate virtually any US based mobile devices,\" the company claimed. A person's precise location can be returned in as little as 15 seconds, according to another case study, and data is usually not cached for longer than two minutes. Other companies then buy access to LocationSmart's data -- or the data is obtained by a customer of LocationSmart, like 3Cinteractive, which is said to have supplied location data to Securus.  But LocationSmart hasn't said how it ensures its corporate customers protect the location data to prevent abuse and misuse. A spokesperson for LocationSmart did not return an email with several questions sent prior to publication.  Companies buy into LocationSmart's location data for many reasons. Sometimes it's to help locate a nearby store, or to send a marketing text message when a person visits a rival store. Location data can even be used by companies to track deliveries or shipments, or by banks to fight fraud, such as if a person is making card transactions miles apart within just a few minutes of each other.  In any case, the company LocationSmart also said it allows some customers to obtain \"implied\" consent, used on a case-by-case basis, when \"the nature of the service implies that location will be used.\" The company said one example could be when a stranded motorist calls roadside assistance, and the event implies the person is \"calling to be found.\" The company even has (Screenshot: ZDNet)The data aggregator said While that may be true, the requirement to obtain a person's consent collapses if a search warrant for that data is issued. That's exactly how companies like Securus can reveal location data without asking a person's permission. According to However, as We reached out to the four major US carriers prior to publication. We asked how each carrier obtains consent from customers to sell their data and what safeguards they put in place to prevent abuse.  Sprint spokesperson Lisa Belot said the company shares personally identifiable location data \"only with customer consent or in response to a lawful request such as a validated court order from law enforcement.\"  The company's Sprint said the company's relationship with Securus \"does not include data sharing,\" and is limited \"to supporting efforts to curb unlawful use of contraband cell phones in correctional facilities.\" When asked the same questions, Verizon spokesperson Rich Young provided a boilerplate response regarding Securus and would not comment further. \"We're still trying to verify their activities, but if this company is, in fact, doing this with our customers' data, we will take steps to stop it,\" he said.  ATT spokesperson Jim Greer said in a statement: \"We have a best practices approach to handling our customers' data. We are aware of the letter and will provide a response.\" Our questions were also not answered. A spokesperson for T-Mobile did not respond by our deadline. \"It's important for us to close off that potential loophole and that can easily be done with one line of legislative language,\" said Bankston, \"which would also have the benefit of making every other company careful about always getting consent before disclosing your data to anyone.\" Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, called on each carrier to stop sharing data with third parties. Wyden argued the sharing \"skirts wireless carriers' legal obligation to be the sole conduit by which the government may conduct surveillance of Americans' phone records.\" In a blog post, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said law enforcement Wyden has also called on the FCC to investigate the carriers for allegedly not obtaining user consent.  The FCC has not said yet if it willsaid if it will investigate.

The young man hacked into the computer system of Mount Diablo Unified School District and changed not only his grades but those of other students as well.  \"We wrote numerous search warrants to get the IP addresses of the possible phishing site email. We got it and we did good old fashioned police detective work and we narrowed it down to an address,\" Sgt. Carl Cruz, the Concord Police financial crimes supervisor told Investigators traced the attack back to the student’s house, revealing that the messages were part of a phishing campaign. A malicious link within the messages directed the email recipients to a fake website.  Once on the fraudulent, student-created site, which mirrored the school’s portal, teachers were prompted to enter their user credentials. “The site would record any information entered, allowing the student to hijack the teacher’s account,” “This was a classic credential harvesting phishing scam – basic security awareness training could have prevented this attack. Maybe it was the teacher, but, whatever the reason, it’s no secret that the education sector has limited finances and cybersecurity is not a top priority,” said Bob Adams, cybersecurity expert, Police believe the student changed the grades of 10–15 students, raising some, while lowering others. Because the student is a juvenile, his name remains withheld; however, he has been arrested on 14 felony counts.  In related news, another student in East Brewton, Alabama, who also Escambia County superintendent of education John Knott wrote in an email today, \"W. S. Neal High school administrators reported discrepancies where grades on report cards didn't match their transcripts. We reported our findings to the Alabama State Department of Education and law enforcement and began an investigation into the matter. We have also brought in additional resources that could aide in this investigation to determine the facts and resolve this matter.      \"We are determined to make sure the records are correct, to ascertain how these changes happened, and hold all that may be involved accountable. We are working to complete this process in order to release to the top 10 students, including the valedictorian and salutatorian, by graduation.\"    High school hacking is nothing new, nor are phishing scams.   “Unfortunately, there isn’t one industry deemed ‘safe’ when it comes to targeted attacks. Hospitals, religious organizations, charities and even schools have all been, and will continue to be, targeted by any number of individuals for any number of reasons,” said Adams.

Customer data from Europe, Singapore, Australia, Japan, and South Korea will also be moved, with other countries to follow. The company, headquartered in Moscow, Russia, says the transition is part of the Global Transparency Initiative. In 2017, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ordered federal agencies to According to the agency, Russian laws allows the Kremlin to potentially lean on Kaspersky Lab to perform cyberespionage and intercept communications connected to Russian networks.       The DHS suggested that due to these laws, the Russian government could use Kaspersky products as a conduit to compromise US national security. The cybersecurity firm has firmly denied these accusations, as well as having \"inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia.\" The \"The new measures are the next steps in the development of the initiative, but they also reflect the company's commitment to working with others to address the growing challenges of industry fragmentation and a breakdown of trust,\" the cybersecurity firm says. \"Trust is essential in cybersecurity, and Kaspersky Lab understands that trust is not a given; it must be repeatedly earned through transparency and accountability.\" Kaspersky also intends to relocate the tools used to assemble software to Zurich, and by the end of 2018, the company says that both Kaspersky Lab products and threat detection rule databases will begin to be assembled and signed off in the country. \"The relocation will ensure that all newly assembled software can be verified by an independent organization, and show that software builds and updates received by customers match the source code provided for audit,\" Kaspersky added. The transition of systems and data will be overseen by an unnamed independent third party that is based in Switzerland.  In addition, the cybersecurity firm has pledged to open its first Transparency Center in Switzerland this year. Eventually, the center will make the source code of Kaspersky products available for review by stakeholders. \"In a rapidly changing industry such as ours, we have to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients, stakeholders and partners,\" said Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky Lab. \"Transparency is one such need, and that is why we've decided to redesign our infrastructure and move our data processing facilities to Switzerland.

The campaign seems to have focused on the domestic SPEI transfer network, and as such is reminiscent of the recent spate of sophisticated attacks on the global SWIFT inter-bank messaging system.  Lorenza Martinez, head of Banxico’s payment system, told Reuters that five lenders had seen unauthorized transfers and that they are currently running analysis to see if malicious insiders were involved.  SPEI itself is not thought to have been compromised but rather the software used by banks to connect to it, she added.

Bulletin According to Adobe, the updates address vulnerabilities “whose successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.”  Of the 24 critical CVEs, CVE-2018-4947, CVE-2018-4948, CVE-2018-4966, CVE-2018-4968, CVE-2018-4978, CVE-2018-4982, and CVE-2018-4984 are heap overflow vulnerabilities.  The final bunch of 13 vulnerabilities — CVE-2018-4946, CVE-2018-4952, CVE-2018-4954, CVE-2018-4958, CVE-2018-4959, CVE-2018-4961, CVE-2018-4971, CVE-2018-4974, CVE-2018-4977, CVE-2018-4980, CVE-2018-4983, CVE-2018-4988, and CVE-2018-4989 — are use-after-free flaws.  The remaining “important” rated CVEs range from security bypass and out-of-bounds read laws to memory corruption, NTLM SSO hash theft and HTTP POST new line injection via XFA submission.  They could allow information disclosure and security bypass, according to Adobe.  The firm also issued bulletin “Adobe has released updates for Photoshop CC for Windows and macOS,” the summary noted.  “These updates resolve a critical vulnerability in Photoshop CC 19.1.3 and earlier 19.x versions, as well as 18.1.3 and earlier 18.x versions. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.”  The security updates follow last week’s Amid an accounting investigation, Symantec executives outlined their outlook for future quarters and highlighted how the company's products are becoming more subscription based with recurring revenue revolving around 3 year terms. The word of the day for Symantec was \"ratable.\" In fact, ratable was mentioned 43 times as CEO Greg Clark and CFO Nicholas Noviello talked to analysts during a conference call just 4 days after the last one. Symantec shares were hammered last week after the company disclosed an accounting probe spurred by a former employee.                       The technology world has spent so much of the past two decades focused on innovation that security has often been an afterthought. Learn how and why it is finally changing.                                           When Symantec reported earnings last week and Symantec didn't have a lot to say about the beginning of the accounting investigation, but did say it would halt buybacks and freeze executive pay until the issues were resolved. The official line on the investigation is as follows: Now the main mission for Clark and Noviello was to highlight how Symantec's outlook is solid. The executives were confident about Symantec's enterprise business, which is moving to as-a-service and recurring revenue based on three year contracts. In other words, Symantec's business model is going to look like most software-as-a-service companies in the future.         Clark noted: All of that sounds good, but analysts zoomed in on the ratable discussion. Symantec talked about ratables more in terms of billings not revenue. Enter even more confusion. Add it up and Symantec's call, which highlighted a bevy of positive points, also may have just added to the accounting confusion.        Overall, Symantec projected revenue growth in the mid to high single digits for fiscal year 2020. Enterprise security will see sales growth of high single digits to low double digits. Consumer digital safety will see sales growth of low to mid single digits.  The analyst research notes on Tuesday indicated that Symantec's accounting investigation will continue to cast a pall over the company. Simply put, Symantec needs to hit its targets over time to win Wall Street back.  Stifel analyst Gur Talpaz said in a research note: In our view, despite management's assurance that no material adverse impact to the company's historical financial results stemming from the outcome of the company's internal investigation into claims made by a former employee is currently expected, we are not in the business of speculation, and we lack the necessary color at this time to fully understand the potential financial consequences of this investigation.  Further, in regard to Symantec's enterprise security business, management has yet to prove, in our view, that they have a firm grasp on the pace at which the consumption preference of customers has shifted away from perpetual license contracts to cloud-based subscriptions and, consequently, this trend's impact on the company's operating model. We would like to see management effectively execute against its stated targets in a more consistent manner.  BTIG analyst Joel Fishbein also noted that Symantec took a solid first step, but there are multiple questions surrounding the company. \"We appreciate management's decision to host the briefing, but questions still remain surrounding what impact the investigation may have on future financials and guidance,\" said Fishbein.                                  \tAdobe has released a large security update which tackles 47 vulnerabilities only a week after the firm's customary monthly patch round. The latest patch update impacts Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and MacOS, alongside Adobe Photoshop CC for Windows and macOS. Security updates for Acrobat DC impact the consumer version 2018.011.20038 and earlier, as well as Classic 2015 versions 2015.006.30417 and earlier. The consumer version of Acrobat Reader DC versions 2018.011.20038 and earlier, as well as Classic 2017 versions 2017.011.30079 and earlier, and Classic 2015 versions 2015.006.30417 and earlier are affected. Adobe Acrobat 2017 versions 2018.011.20038 and earlier are also impacted by this security update.        In total, 24 vulnerabilities resolved in these updates are deemed critical. If exploited, successful attacks may result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. The resolved critical bugs include a double free problem, seven heap overflow vulnerabilities, 13 use-after-free bugs, a type confusion issue, an untrusted pointer dereference error and one out-of-bounds write security flaw.       In addition, Adobe has patched a plethora of out-of-bounds read, type confusion security vulnerabilities, and memory corruption problems which could lead to information leaks. When it comes to Adobe Photoshop CC, the tech giant's According to Adobe, exploitation of the lone out-of-bounds write bug could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. Adobe says that no reports have been received which suggest these vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild.  However, users are recommended to update their builds as soon as possible.

On Tuesday, Open-source projects, software, and library adoption have become a common theme in the enterprise. Open-source systems can save a vast amount of time and money for developers and businesses alike and many well-known players in fields ranging from technology to core services use open-source components on a daily basis. However, the nature of open-source projects means that as developers are giving away their time for free, sometimes, bugs may escape the net and cause chaos further down the line unless users and staff are aware of its use and maintain regular security checks. In 2017, for example, Equifax In the same year, Black Duck Software researchers found through an audit of 1,000 commonly-used applications in the enterprise that 96 percent utilized open-source software, and over Some of the bugs found were over four years old.       It seems little has changed. The Burlington, Mass.,-based firm's After auditing a total of 1,100 commercial databases used by companies in industries including cybersecurity, automotive, healthcare, manufacturing, and mobile applications, the average number of open-source components found per codebase was 257, an uptick of 75 percent over a 12-month period. However, 78 percent of the codebases examined contained at least one security vulnerability due to open-source components, and on average, 64 vulnerabilities per codebase were found. Many of the security flaws uncovered in the codebases were publicly disclosed as far back as six years ago. According to the researchers, over 54 percent of the vulnerabilities found are critical issues, and 17 percent contained well-known bugs such as  In total, eight percent of the databases utilized Apache Struts, and 33 percent of these codebases contained the vulnerability (Perhaps ironically, the most vulnerabilities were present in codebases used in the IT  software infrastructure industry, and cybersecurity systems, at 67 percent and 41 percent respectively. \"Since modern software and infrastructure depend heavily on open-source technologies, having a clear view of components in use is a key part of corporate governance,\" said Tim Mackey, Technical Evangelist at Black Duck by Synopsys. \"With the growth in open-source use, organizations need to ensure they have the tools to detect vulnerabilities in open-source components and manage whatever license compliance their use of open source may require.\" Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

But the trend toward building partnerships in order to protect businesses, governments and consumers from cybercrimes in today’s fast-expanding threat landscape is on the rise.  In a A branch of Europol, the European Cybercrime Center (EC3) was created in 2013 to better protect EU citizens, businesses and governments against cybercrimes. EC3 head of business Steve Wilson anticipates that the partnership will enhance law enforcement's ability to both prevent and disrupt crime.  \"Working co-operation of this type between Europol and industry is the most effective way in which we can hope to secure cyberspace for European citizens and businesses. I am confident that the high level of expertise that BT bring will result in a significant benefit to our Europe-wide investigations,\" Wilson said.  In early 2018, BT launched its free, collaborative platform for sharing malware information, which enabled the company to start sharing intelligence on malicious software and websites with other ISPs. BT has since identified more than 200,000 domains and shared actionable intelligence that has allowed customers to better defend against specific threats.  With the goal of creating a safer digital world, the agreement between BT and Europol is an important step forward when it comes to bridging the worlds of the private and public sectors.   “We’re working with other law enforcement agencies in a similar vein to better share cyber security intelligence, expertise and best practice to help them expose and take action against the organised gangs of cyber criminals lurking in the dark corners of the web. The signing of today’s accord with Europol sees BT take another significant step forward in making the internet a safer place for consumers, businesses and public sector bodies in the UK, Europe and beyond,” said Kevin Brown, VP, BT security threat intelligence.       \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 A newly-uncovered form of DDoS attack takes advantage of a well-known, yet still exploitable, security vulnerability in the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) networking protocol to allow attackers to bypass common methods for detecting their actions. Attacks are launched from irregular source ports, making it difficult to determine their origin and blacklist the ports in order to protect against future incidents. The new form of distributed denial-of-service attack has been uncovered and detailed by The UPnP protocol is commonly used for device discovery, The protocol is still used, despite known issues around poor default settings, lack of authentication, and UPnP-specific remote code execution vulnerabilities, which make the devices vulnerable to attack.  \"Just like the much-discussed case of easily exploitable IoT devices, most UPnP device vendors prefer focusing on compliance with the protocol and easy delivery, rather than security,\" Avishay Zawoznik, security research team leader at Imperva, told ZDNet. \"Many vendors reuse open UPnP server implementations for their devices, not bothering to modify them for a better security performance.\" Examples of problems with the protocol go all the way back to 2001, but the simplicity of using it means it is still widely deployed. However, Imperva researchers claim the discovery of how it can be used to make DDoS attacks more difficult to attack could mean widespread problems. \"We have discovered a new DDoS attack technique, which uses known vulnerabilities, and has the potential to put any company with an online presence at risk of attack,\" said Zawoznik.  Researchers first noticed something was new during a Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) attack in April. This type of botnet tends to be small and spoofs their victim's IP addresses in order to query common internet connected devices such as routers, printers and access points. While most of the attacks were arriving from the usual SSDP port number of 1900, around 12 percent of payloads were arriving from randomised source ports. Imperva investigated and found that a UPnP-integrated attack method could be used to hide source port information. Attackers could easily find devices to take advantage of In order to not fall victim to this, businesses \"should  come up with a DDoS protection that is based on the packet payloads, rather than source ports only,\" said Zawoznik. However, researchers note that there is a relatively simple way to protect systems from this and other UNPnP exploits: just block the device from being remotely accessible, because in the vast majority of cases, they note, \"it serves no useful function or has any benefit for device users\". \t\tAs the enterprise transitions towards the cloud, mobile, and next-generation technologies, a critical need has emerged to secure applications and authenticate users, keep cyberattackers at bay, and maintain control over business-critical systems and information. This is where Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solutions come in. IDaaS providers utilize cloud technology for authentication purposes, catering for multiple authentication requirements, single sign-on systems, and privilege-related access to data while saving time and resources. Bellevue, WA-based Auth0 is best known for its IDaaS Universal Identity Platform, which secures web, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), and internal applications. The firm says it secures over 1.5 billion logins per month and caters for customers in over 70 countries.        Current clients include VMware, AMD, Mazda, NVIDIA, and News Corp. It appears that investors in the technology field have taken an interest in IDaaS, considering the success of Auth0's latest series D funding round.       The firm secured a fresh cash injection of $55 million through the round, led by Sapphire Ventures. Other participants included World Innovation Lab, Bessemer Venture Partners, Trinity Ventures, Meritech Capital, and K9 Ventures. Auth0 says that the funding will be used to \"continue innovation of the company's Universal Identity Platform, accelerate go-to-market programs, and drive global expansion.\" \"We are humbled by the support from our investors, and emboldened in our mission to provide the most extensible, powerful, and easy-to-use identity management solution available,\" said Eugenio Pace, CEO, and co-founder of Auth0. \"We look forward to using these funds to make our product and company even better, and to continue offering value to our incredible customers around the world.\" \tThe latest funding builds upon four previous rounds which raised a collective $54.3 million. To date, Auth0 has secured over $110 million from investors. \"Our goal is to identify companies that demonstrate consistent high growth in an industry that has incredible market potential,\" said Anders Ranum, Partner at Sapphire Ventures. \"Between the outstanding leadership of the company and their disruptive technology offering, Auth0 offers that unique combination and then some.

In fact, according to the The report looked at 5,375 vulnerabilities published during the first three months of 2018 and found an increase of 1.8% over the same period last year. Of all the Q1 disclosures, eight vendors accounted for 22.9% of the vulnerabilities.  Risk Based Security published 1,790 more vulnerabilities than common vulnerability exposures (CVEs) in Q1, suggesting that \"organizations relying on CVE or sources solely obtaining data from CVE are missing a significant number of disclosed vulnerabilities,\" the report said.  Additionally, web-related vulnerabilities represent almost half (47.5%) of all Q1 2018 vulnerabilities and 49.1% of all publicly disclosed vulnerabilities able to be remotely exploited.  \"As more and more vulnerabilities are reported, organizations are forced to spend an increasing amount of time and resources to stay properly informed about the weaknesses affecting their IT infrastructure and applications,\" the report said.   Organizations continue to grapple with vulnerability intelligence. Vulnerability disclosure and the issue of organizations better managing vulnerabilities are what many are looking to address of late.

They were identified as being behind the Dark Caracal attacks in which the group used various techniques to harvest data,\" the report said.     Then the Dutch experienced a taste of the limelight when they uncovered the hack of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential election in the US by penetrating Russia’s Cozy Bear organization.   While China continues to top the charts with its nation-sponsored attack activity, aspects of these these lesser-known nation-states give cause for concern. \"These groups have shown that the bar for conducting successful operations is not as high as one might think, and that they can hide within the noise of modern day networks for as long as needed,\" the report said.  Regardless of their infamy, nation-states are evolving in their attack vectors with the goal of using more social media to influence the opinions and actions of large populations. According to the report, \"2017 saw the trend of state-sponsored exploits shift from cyber-physical to cyber-social with interference in several elections across Europe. 2018 is showing sharp repercussions for this information warfare with criminal indictments.\"  Using cyber-social attacks on European and American elections, Russia showed the relative ease with which it could pull off these cost-effective attacks.

Big Brother Watch claimed that the tech is “almost entirely inaccurate,” with false positives at the Metropolitan Police of 98%, despite millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money being spent.  There are also serious privacy concerns, with South Wales Police said to have stored images of 2400 innocent people incorrectly matched by facial recognition for a year, without their knowledge.  The use of this technology could breach the Human Rights Act, according to the group.  “Real-time facial recognition is a dangerously authoritarian surveillance tool that could fundamentally change policing in the UK. Members of the public could be tracked, located and identified — or misidentified — everywhere they go,” warned Big Brother Watch director, Silkie Carlo.  “We’re seeing ordinary people being asked to produce ID to prove their innocence as police are wrongly identifying thousands of innocent citizens as criminals. It is deeply disturbing and undemocratic that police are using a technology that is almost entirely inaccurate, that they have no legal power for, and that poses a major risk to our freedoms.”  The campaign has the backing of MP David Lammy and 15 rights and race equality groups including Liberty, Article 19 and the Race Equality Foundation.  Big Brother Watch also raised a wider issue of police handling of custody images, claiming that the photos of innocent members of the public are still kept on file even if they’re released without charge.  They can then end up on the Police National Database and be turned into facial biometrics used to identify individuals via specialized software. The rights group argues that police should delete such images as they do fingerprints and DNA once an individual is found to be innocent or released without charge. \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 \tThe deadline for the EU's GDPR is fast approaching, causing unbridled chaos for some companies. The new regulations are forcing the enterprise and SMBs alike to rethink their perspective on data collection, and while new requirements may help protect consumer privacy and security, businesses are scrambling to meet the European Union's 25 May 2018 deadline. On Wednesday, IBM released the results of a new study into how businesses view the impending changes caused by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  Ahead of the deadline, the majority of companies are now tackling exactly what data they collect and manage -- and as a result, have begun to become more selective. The majority of survey respondents said their organizations have also begun disposing of data in order to comply with the new rules.        Based on the report's data, roughly 80 percent of organizations claim they are cutting down on the amount of personal information they collect and store, 70 percent are disposing of data, and 78 percent are reducing the number of people who have access to stored information. Cutting down data collection, storage, and sharing will help companies manage GDPR -- but will also have a knock-on effect for consumers, too.        In a world full of data breaches and cyberattacks, the more information is stored about individuals through each of the many online services we use, the more risk there is for information to become compromised, whether through the company itself, a third-party, or someone who has access to these records. In total, 76 percent of respondents said that GDPR should improve trust and the relationship between businesses and consumers, with 84 percent believing that GDPR compliance will put their firms in good stead as a differentiator to the public. However, there is still a wide chasm between the European Union's data protection dreams and company action as only 36 percent of organizations believe they will be ready in time. There are challenges associated with GDPR which companies are facing as we speak. Companies have to know exactly what information from consumers has been collected, where it is stored, and whether or not it is accurate and necessary. Organizations must also now comply with the EU's data processing and sharing principles and they must ensure that consent has been given by consumers to keep their information on record. (If you have recently been receiving emails from companies asking to stay in touch, the need for consent ahead of the GDPR deadline is why.) Businesses must also ensure their cross-border data handling complies with the GDPR decree. Another major issue is that companies operating in the EU must report data breaches to regulators within 72 hours. According to IBM's research, only 31 percent of organizations have prepared for this requirement. Despite the current chaos, 22 percent of companies are taking advantage of GDPR to improve their business operators. Of this subset, 93 percent have modified their incident response setups, 79 percent are preparing for data accuracy checks, and 74 percent were implementing new security and privacy systems for products and services. \"GDPR will be one of the biggest disruptive forces impacting business models across industries -- and its reach extends far beyond the EU borders,\" said Cindy Compert, CTO, Data Security  Privacy at IBM Security. \"The onset of GDPR also comes during a time of huge distrust among consumers toward businesses ability to protect their personal data.\" \"These factors together have created a perfect storm for companies to rethink their approach to data responsibility and begin to restore the trust needed in today's data-driven economy,\" the executive added.

A BSI spokesperson confirmed to The new initiative, which the BSI claims is an industry first, will help IT buyers to sort through the huge variety of products on the market, and hopefully raise baseline security standards.  In order to achieve a kitemark, a manufacturer must first be assessed against ISO 9001, with the product in question required to pass an assessment of functionality and interoperability plus scanning for software vulnerabilities and other security flaws. Further functional and interoperability testing, pen testing and audits are undertaken after that and the kitemark will be withdrawn until deficiencies are rectified, the BSI said.  IoT threats represent a security challenge to IT bosses on several fronts. Compromised devices could be conscripted into botnets for mining crypto-currencies or launching DDoS attacks, unsecured endpoints can be hijacked to provide a stepping stone into corporate networks and mission critical facilities could be sabotaged.  The National Crime Agency warnedThe first products to achieve the kitemark are expected to land in the summer. \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 GDPR is just days away, but organisations are still struggling to meet the requirements for compliance with the incoming data protection legislation.                      Enterprise technology vendors are lining up automated tools and artificial intelligence to land customers looking to comply with GDPR by May 25, 2018.                                           The European Union's Those organisations found not to be compliant with GDPR could face fines if found to misuse, exploit, lose, or otherwise mishandle personal data. The financial penalty could potentially reach four percent of company turnover -- a significant amount for any organisation. However, according to a report by global professional services and consultancy firm EY, two-thirds of organisations are still finding it a challenge to be compliant and much more needs to be done in order to meet the requirements. In addition to this, of all those surveyed, the majority said it will take a \"moderate effort\" to implement GDPR requirements for addressing expectations of informing EU citizens where their personal data is processed and for what purpose.        \"Regulations such as GDPR continue to be a significant challenge,\" said Chris Ritterbush, executive director at Ernst  Young LLP. When it comes to verifying that third parties directly gathering personal information from EU citizens obtain consent -- as is dictated by GDPR -- none of the organisations surveyed said they have this capability in place.       Almost half suggested it is still going to take a lot to become compliant with this requirement --five percent of firms will be building capabilities from scratch, while 43 percent reveal it will require major enhancements to their existing capabilities. One of the key components of GDPR will mean organisations that suffer a personal data breach will have to notify EU customers that an incident has occurred within 72 hours of learning about it.  However, even though failure to do this could result in a hefty fine, almost half of those surveyed said they need to implement major enhancements in order to meet this GDPR criteria. Just five percent said they already have the capabilities in place. But the area where the highest number of organisations are having the most difficulty, according to EY, is Of those surveyed, no organisations said they had this capability in place, while 14 percent said they need to build the capabilities from scratch and will have difficulty doing so.

The “The strategy is built on the concepts of mitigating systemic risk and strengthening collective defense,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Tuesday as reported by DHS aims to have improved national cybersecurity risk management and increased security and resilience across government networks and critical infrastructure by 2023.  The strategy is thorough in addressing cyber-threats. Recognizing that the proliferation of connected devices increases risk, DHS details its plans to manage threats from malicious actors with a wide range of motivations. Through a five-pillar strategy that includes risk identification, vulnerability reduction, threat reduction, consequence mitigation and cybersecurity outcome enablement, DHS will first look to gain a better understanding of our national risk posture.  “Understanding these risks at the strategic level will enable us to effectively allocate resources and prioritize efforts to address vulnerabilities, threats, and consequences across all of our cybersecurity activities,” the strategy states.  Driven by the guiding principles of cost-effective risk prioritization that takes a collaborative and global approach toward innovation and agility while balancing equities and honoring national values, DHS plans to mitigate cybersecurity threats at national and systemic levels.  The strategy also states that in order to protect critical infrastructure, DHS will partner with key stakeholders, “including sector specific agencies and the private sector, to drive better cybersecurity by promoting the development and adoption of best practices and international standards, by providing services like risk assessments and other technical offerings, and by improving engagement efforts to advance cybersecurity risk management efforts.”  While many applaud the release of the long-awaited national cybersecurity strategy to address the growing risks from nation-state attacks, some are concerned about the mixed messages coming out of the White House with the announcement that the cybersecurity coordinator position on the National Security Council has been eliminated.  “Eliminating the White House’s top cybersecurity job is vexing for a number of reasons. It comes at a time when our greatest cyber-adversaries, namely Russian, Iran and North Korea, are more relevant than ever on the global stage, and the county already lacks central cybersecurity leadership,” said \"The US needs cybersecurity leadership today more than ever, but the current structure of our top officials needs to be overhauled if we hope to correct course,\" Beri continued. \"Forming a cohesive cyber-defense strategy has become nearly impossible as hundreds of departments report into a siloed set of decision makers. Instead of eliminating jobs we need to be creating them, and the first step in the right direction would be the appointment of a federal CISO to oversee all of our nation’s cybersecurity initiatives and promote interagency collaboration.”  \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Much like physicians,  Unlike physicians, no Their rationale? That it is better than doing nothing or better than what the customer had in place the day before.  This argument is short-sighted and indicates a lack of comprehension of the risk they are imparting to their customers. Is it intentional or mere ignorance on the part of the vendors? And what can enterprises do to protect themselves? How do we get to a new cybersecurity industry ethos, focused on viable solutions and committed to doing no harm?  Apple, Google, and Microsoft have spent millions of dollars, on both technology and developers, to lock down the OS and build resiliency subsystems to make exploitation highly expensive for the attacker in terms of time and labor -- for example, And yet, security vendors (including many of the biggest brands in endpoint, network security and container security) introduce new vulnerabilities and additional risk by breaking the default security boundaries established in all the major operating systems. Many endpoint and network security vendors introduce new attack surfaces by adding complexity. Instead of looking at the root cause of an issue, they continue to branch out and apply point solutions. Sometimes, these solutions break the default secure design principles established by the platform vendors. Endpoint and anti-virus software vendors that do not use privilege-separation and sandboxing therefore create a new and large attack surface at the highest privilege level of the endpoint. Network security appliances are essentiallyInfrastructure security vendors expose guest virtual machine data streams to a complex parser running at the host with root privileges. The In addition to the clearly risky behaviors above, there is a whole subset of solutions that I call homeopathic. Essentially, these do no harm -- but also do not solve any problems. You can safely list most of the governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solutions under this subset.  As an industry, we do a disservice to our customers and the trust that they put in us when we not only solve their real security issues but expose them to much worse. That network appliance on the tap port is a higher order systemic risk than anything else they endured the day before its installation.  In my experience, many Here are a few tips and questions that help cut through the morass of mixed messages and get to the truth behind the hype. We must have an ethical shift in the cybersecurity industry. The majority of solutions are akin to the bloodletting \"cures\" of the dark ages. Count yourself lucky if you don't die from them.  I have been in this industry for over 20 years. Our moral compass is broken and we need to act for the greater good rather than for self-promotion to fill our pockets. We must take action before a massive \"extinction-like\" event. A We cannot afford such a catastrophe. I challenge my fellow security industry leaders to make the changes necessary to evolve the industry for all our benefit. Sinan Eren is chief executive of In a press release on Wednesday, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs stated its “categorical” opposition to draft legislation making its way through the State Duma that would criminalize observing or facilitating foreign sanctions against Russian citizens and Russian enterprises. The organization’s executive board says the law contradicts Vladimir Putin’s stated policy goals by creating “additional conditions for administrative pressure on businesses.” The union warns that foreign countries could target Russian business owners with “secondary sanctions” for obeying the government’s proposed ban on observing Western sanctions, which would limit their access to global markets and ultimately hurt the Russian economy. The organization also objects to the criminalization of sharing information that could facilitate new foreign sanctions, arguing that this could apply to entrepreneurs who disclose information about the activities of their business partners. Mikhail Fedotov, the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, has also criticized the law, saying that arbitrary enforcement means it could be enforced against nearly anyone. The executive board of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs has representatives from some of the biggest enterprises in the country, including Lukoil president Vagit Alekperov, Renova Group head Viktor Vekselberg, Basic Element board chairman Oleg Deripaska, VTB president Andrey Kostin, and others.            The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) has revealed its intention to probe the use of blockchain for Centrelink welfare payment delivery. Acting CEO Randall Brugeaud told the CeBIT Australia conference in Sydney on Wednesday that a prototype could be in the market come mid-2019. \"Our plan is to look for use cases across the Commonwealth with an initial focus on the welfare payment delivery system, then working with our digital service standard, we'll conduct user research with a view to having a prototype by the end of next financial year,\" he explained. The DTA was given Pointing to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) \"The potential of blockchain to securely record transactions will be investigated, drawing on the experience of other public and private sector organisations,\" he said.       \"We'll also build on work done across government already, such as the CSIRO's work on distributed ledgers.\" The DTA is also looking into artificial intelligence and machine learning, with Brugeaud noting in particular the agency is looking at how such technologies can drive better government service delivery. \"We're looking at how these technologies might offer automated service channels that are closer to the human experience; this might include intelligent chatbots, or voice-enabled channels which are proving to be effective in other sectors,\" he continued. \"We think these have the potential to deliver significant benefits for government service delivery.\" Brugeaud, who has been with the DTA for seven weeks while its CEO is overseas on leave, is the Australian Bureau of Statistics' deputy Australian statistician. He said the DTA is looking at making its services more \"consumable\" by other government departments, and also private entities. Additionally, he said the DTA is looking to governments around the world for ideas. As first \"Our international experience demonstrates the importance of digital identity ... digital identity opens doors for more digital transformation and joined-up services. It's a critical first step making it easier for end users to deal with government,\" Brugeaud told CeBIT on Wednesday. Currently, there are more than 30 different log on views across the Australian government to provide access to digital services; under the new digital identity solution, users will only need to establish their identity once and then use it multiple times across government services. \"By the end of next financial year, we will have rolled out pilots to almost half a million users of government services,\" Brugeaud said. One of the first pilots relates to tax file numbers (TFN), which was Users are able to complete their TFN application online, but this needs to be printed and taken along with identity documents to an Australia Post Office to be finalised. There are 750,000 applications for TFNs each year. \"With a digital identity, the current month-long process will be shrunk to minutes, without leaving a computer,\" Brugeaud continued. \"The pilot will be available in October 2018. \"After this, we will be gradually bringing other services online, including grants management, business registration, student services, and some Centrelink services.\" The DTA anticipates that around 2.8 million transactions will be moved online as a result of this. This work will also be underpinned by a new digital identity platform that will comprise two main components: The identity provider and the exchange. \"Together they will deliver seamless experience and protect users' identities,\" the acting CEO continued. \"To provide users with control and choice, we are delivering a federated model, governed by the trusted digital identity framework (TDIF) ... allowing users to choose from a range of accredited identity providers.\" Initially, there will be one Commonwealth identity provider, with Brugeaud saying the DTA will be encouraging providers such as Australia Post and others across the private sector and state and territory governments to be accredited. The Department of Human Services will operate the exchange between services and the identity provider. \"The exchange will be critical in protecting the privacy ... services providers will not see any of the users identity information and in reverse, identity providers will not know what services each user is accessing,\" Brugeaud said. Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Angus Taylor has told the CeBIT Australia conference in Sydney on Thursday that the federal government's push to access encrypted communication is one of his highest priorities, but he refused to offer a date of when legislation can be expected. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, along with his Questioning if the proposed legislation was technically possible, ZDNet asked the prime minister if the \"The laws of Australia prevail in Australia, I can assure you of that,\" Turnbull told ZDNet. \"The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.\" During his media rounds, Turnbull made sure he let Australia know his intention was to protect the nation from terrorism and criminal rings such as those involved in paedophilia, rather than nutting out the technical specs of the laws While no further detail was offered on Thursday, Taylor said the Coalition still intends to introduce legislation that would force companies to bend to the government's will. Pointing to the \"95 percent of ASIOs most concerning counter-terrorism targets actively use encrypted messaging ... and 90 percent of data lawfully intercepted by the federal police use some form of encryption,\" the minister said. Taylor said Australian agencies predict that by 2020, most communications will be end-to-end encrypted. \"Let me be clear about this, we support strong encryption for the security of information and the protection of privacy. We firmly believe that cybersecurity will be enhanced by encryption -- it is a good thing,\" Taylor continued. \"But its near-ubiquitous use in the coming years poses a very serious threat for law enforcement and the Australian public have the right to expect a company operating in Australia will assist where they can -- within reason -- and that being the important qualifier, with lawful requests to access for data.\" Taylor said progressing the work on legislation that Turnbull announced in July is \"one of my highest priorities\". \"The focus is on getting it right, not rushing it,\" Taylor said of the looming date of the legislation. \"This is a big issue across the world, I'm speaking with agencies across the world ... we see encryption as crucial for cybersecurity. \"To weaken encryption as a means for supporting law enforcement that's not what we want ... I also think we can support law enforcement without breaking encryption.\"  \t \tSeven months after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told ZDNet the laws of Australia will trump the laws of mathematics, Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton has discussed looming legislation that would force companies to help the government access communications.  \t \tRSA's VP and GM of Global Public Sector Practice Mike Brown believes there's a better way to thwart terrorism than breaking end-to-end encryption, as recently proposed by the Australian government.  \t \tA prime minister that understands the seriousness of cybersecurity combined with cross-government and public-private information sharing initiatives has sent Australia to the fore, according to Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Angus Taylor.  \t \tThe centre's chair has called for an overarching capability that supports federal, state, and territory-based cybercrime-countering efforts, labelling current capacities 'relatively weak'.              \t \tOptus has announced doubling its National Broadband Network (NBN) customers during the FY18 financial year, with CEO Allen Lew revealing to ZDNet that Australia's second-largest telco has expanded its 5G research to the  \t \t \tLew added that Optus has yet to choose its infrastructure technology partner for the 5G rollout.  \t \t\"The [5G] preparations are certainly ongoing, we haven't chosen a partner yet, but we have been looking at different options and different infrastructure providers,\" Lew told ZDNet during the telco's FY18 financial results call.  \t \t\"We are also in the process now of looking at propagation characteristics for the 3.6GHz frequency, which is a higher frequency range than we've used before, and to make sure that we understand the impact of buildings, trees, geography, etc, on that.  \t \t\"So we are progressing along well in our plans in order that we can launch the 5G fixed-wireless access service in January next year for Australians.\"         \t \tThe CEO also addressed the affect of the recent  \t  \t\"As far as Optus is concerned, we are a very responsible  telecommunications provider and we have proven in the past that we will  work with the government authorities to make sure that we have an  infrastructure that meets the needs of not just the consumer but more  importantly has the protection and security necessary,\" Lew said on Thursday.        \t \t\"When we make our final decision on [5G] infrastructure provider, we will take all this into consideration.\"  \t \tPointing to its  \t  \t\"We have benefited from the showcase that we put up in the Gold Coast  to better understand which of the applications that we had up there have  resonated with customers, and we now have a clear indication of when we  need to go out to market, what we need to provide, in addition to just  pure connectivity and super high-speed broadband services,\" Lew told  ZDNet.  \t \tAs of the end of March, Optus had 10.106 million mobile customers -- 3.7 million in prepaid, 5.3 million in post-paid, and 1.1 million in mobile broadband -- up from 9.7 million this time last year.

This assures that the country will remain a massive target -- and continued haven -- for cyberattacks.\"  \tThe report is based on global attack and incident response data gathered from NTT Security and supported NTT operating companies from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.  \t \tThe Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has received 63 data breach notifications in first six weeks of the scheme's operation.  \t \tAlthough 63 data breaches were reported to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in less than six weeks, FireEye's Mandiant has warned the figure is higher, but organisations are unsure if their breach fits the brief.  \t \tSouth Korea and Taiwan also are on the top 20 list of global markets that saw the most bot traffic last year, while China was the third most common origin of malicious traffic, behind leader United States and Russia.  \t \tAlmost half of companies across five Asia-Pacific markets view employees' lack of cybersecurity awareness as the biggest threat, with 67 percent describing internal threat as a risk the organisation.  \t \tData breaches can be chaotic and stressful episodes.

Streamlining management will improve efficiency, reduce bureaucracy and increase accountability,” Senior lawmakers were quick to hit back, among them Democrat Mark Warner, who is vice chairman of the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee.  “It’s frankly mindboggling that the Trump Administration has eliminated the top White House official responsible for a whole-of-government cyber strategy, at a time when the cyber threat to our nation is greater than ever,” he “Our adversaries are investing heavily in 21Ross Rustici, senior director, intelligence services, at    “In situations where minutes matter, the most prepared person in the room almost always carries the day.

Unfortunately for would-be investors, many of these events simply fleece them of cryptocurrency and gives back nothing in return. HoweyCoins was so named as a reference to the Howey test, which is used to determine whether or not a transaction is an investment contract. The four-part test, established in 1946, ascertains whether or not a transaction is an investment contract or security. If it is the latter, it is generally under SEC regulation. If ICOs come under securities law, ICO traders must be vetted and offering companies and advisors need to have a strong, thorough knowledge of how to conduct securities events.

In its last update before the EU GDPR takes effect, the privacy watchdog revealed a rise in incident reports from 815 to 957. Although cybersecurity-related incidents increased by 31% from the previous quarter, the first month-on-month increase since Q4 2016-17, human error dominated.  In fact, over the 2017-18 financial year, 3325 reports were The healthcare sector accounted for by far the largest volume of reports (37%), although this figure is likely to be a result of mandatory reporting rules. After health came “general business” (11%), education (11%) and local government (10%).  “Interestingly, there are far more incidents caused by human error than there are external cyber-threats, suggesting that a lot more work needs to be done on training employees,” he added.  “Often, however, cyber-threats can lay unnoticed for months or even years and so this data may well be skewed towards incidents that are immediately identifiable. This information should not, therefore, lure anyone into a false sense of security. We’d encourage all organizations across the UK to up their vigilance against any and all threats, whether that’s external threats lying dormant or unwitting employees making mistakes.”   \"Now the GDPR is upon us, it is more imperative than ever that organizations adopt an approach that’s focused on users, working out what technology and support they can give their employees to help them handle data safely at work,” he added. \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 \tA new form of cryptominer has been discovered which crashes systems the moment antivirus products attempt to remove the malware. The malware, dubbed WinstarNssmMiner by On Wednesday, the cybersecurity firm said the cryptomining malware aims to infect PCs in order to steal processing power for the purpose of mining the Monero cryptocurrency. WinstarNssmMiner is brutal code as it will crash victim PCs the moment antivirus products detect and attempt to remove it. The cryptominer launches the svchost.exe process -- used to manage system services -- and injects malicious code into the file. One injected process begins mining cryptocurrency while the other runs in the background to avoid detection and scan for antivirus protection.        In the second stage, WinstarNssmMiner then tampers with CriticalProcess, adding a process attribute which allows the malware to crash the system at whim. However, the malware is a coward at heart. As 360 Total Security writes, WinstarNssmMiner \"turns off antivirus protection of defenseless foes and backs off when facing sharp swords.\"       The malware scans compromised systems for antivirus products. Any \"decent\" solutions offered by reputable companies -- such as Kaspersky Lab and Avast -- and will quit automatically if these types of antivirus products are discovered. However, if weaker antivirus systems are in use, the crash process starts up and victims have to live with crippling slowness and blue screens while the malware cheerfully steals their power and mines Monero on the attacker's behalf. \"Due to the nature of digital currency mining, cryptominers use up victims' processing power for the sake of their distributors,\" the researchers note. \"Some savvy users are able to identify and terminate the CPU consuming applications. Hence, WinstarNssmMiner protects itself by configuring its mining processes' attribute to CriticalProcess so infected computers crash when users terminate it.\" Four mining pools have been linked to the malware at present. At the time of writing, the threat actors behind the spread of WinstarNssmMiner have mined 133 Monero, which is equivalent to roughly $26,500. The malware is based on IBM, for example, has connected XMRig to  Earlier this week, researchers from RedLock warned that cryptojacking attacks are on the Up to 25 percent of organizations are thought to have experienced cryptojacking activity within their cloud environments this year alone.

DNS attacks come in various flavors, but usually involve denial of service, infecting DNS infrastructure with malware designed to take the user to malicious sites, or exfiltrating data via DNS tunneling techniques.  EfficientIP found DNS-based malware and phishing (36%) were the most popular attacks, followed by DDoS (20%) and similar lock-up domain attacks (20%), and DNS tunneling (20%).  The report clearly shows the potentially major impact DNS attacks can have on organizations: 40% of respondents claimed they suffered cloud outages, one-third (33%) were victims of data theft and 22% suffered lost business.  In the UK, 20% lost sensitive data, 15% had IP stolen, and 21% lost customers, The global average cost per DNS attack increased by 57% year-on-year, but in the UK the figure soared 105%, with firms paying nearly $4m annually.  An EfficientIP spokesman told “The research shows the cost and frequency of attacks have increased exponentially in the financial sector,” he said. “A likely explanation could be that the City is an ideal target for hackers as it provides lucrative and vulnerable targets. The TSB IT disaster is a good example of this: TSB made its customers ideal targets for phishing attacks.”  In fact, UK financial services firms faced on average eight attacks, more than any other industry, according to the report. These cost an average of £681,000 per attack, equating to around £5.4m each year. \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 \tAn adware bundle has been discovered which installs software to mine cryptocurrency on user PCs without their consent. Analysts Now, FileTour has introduced a new component which steals user processing power for the purpose of mining for cryptocurrency.  Known as cryptojacking, this practice involves the use of often-legitimate mining scripts which are deployed on browsers without user consent, before funneling the proceeds to mining pools controlled by threat actors.        According to the publication, the bundle creates a Windows autorun which launches the Google Chrome browser -- in a way which is invisible. By using specific code to launch the browser, the software forces Chrome to launch in an invisible, headless state. The browser then connects to a mining page whenever the user logs into Windows. This page launches the CoinCube mining script that steals processing power to mine Monero.       CPU usage may spike to up to 80 percent, and while victims may notice their PCs are slow, it could be a very long time before the software is uncovered and removed -- or users may simply blame Chrome as the oddity. The researcher opened the website page responsible for the script in a standard browser window and came across an interesting element of the script; the page masquerades as a Cloudflare anti-DDoS page. We are likely to see more and more use cases of cryptojacking. The technique is already becoming common in attacks against In an interesting case of adware and cryptocurrency mining colliding this March, cybersecurity researchers from Netlab 306 The company used domain DGA technology to generate random domain addresses to circumvent ad blockers, but then went further by using this technique to deploy cryptocurrency mining scripts.

A criminal group keen to take advantage of the potentially lucrative opportunities offered by                      Secure payment system Bitcoin has many legitimate uses, but like other technologies, it's also been beneficial to cybercriminals seeking new ways to extort money.                                           Dubbed MEWKit by The attack injects scripts into active web sessions and silently and invisibly executes bank transfers just seconds after the user logs into their cryptocurrency account. Researchers note that MyEtherWallet is an appealing target for attackers because it is simple to use, but its lack of security compared to other banks and exchanges make it a prominent target for attack. Once the user hits a MEWKit page, the phishing attack gets underway with credentials including logins and the private key of the wallet being logged by the attackers.        After that, the crooks look to drain accounts when the victim decrypts their wallet. The scam uses scripts which automatically create the fund transfer by pressing the buttons like a legitimate user would, all while the activity remains hidden -- it's the first time an attack has been seen to use this automated tactic. \"This attack demonstrates how actors are changing their tactics to target the unique vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency's surrounding services and implementations,\" said Yonathan Klijsnma, threat researcher at RiskIQ.  \"MEWKit combines the tactics of both traditional phishing attacks and the functionality of an [automated transfer service] for a tailor-made way to clear the relatively low barriers of MyEtherWallet.\" The back end of MEWKit allows the attackers to monitor how much Ethereum has been collected, as well as keeping a record of private user keys and passwords which can potentially be used for further attacks. Those behind MEWKit appear to have been active for some time and have carried out some sophisticated campaigns. Researchers say MewKit demonstrates a \"new dedicated effort from threat actors to pursue cryptocurrency\" and that the campaign is \"highly lucrative and will continue to be in operation for the foreseeable future\". Researchers haven't been able to pin down the criminal group or groups behind the attacks, but the location of some of the IP addresses involved in the redirection of wallets suggests that the operation is \"by a native Russian speaker who is familiar with financial terms\". In order to avoid falling for this form of attack, RiskIQ urges all MyEtherWallet users to use caution when using the platform. \"Please keep a very close eye on which URL you open, and, preferably, have a bookmarked page for MyEtherWallet or type the domain name yourself,\" warns the report, which also tells users not to  use links claiming to be the service that have been sent via email or social media.

According to Dragos, CHRYSENE has moved beyond email spear phishing and is now using strategic web compromise - watering holes - to exploit victims.   Analysis after the 2012 attack revealed that the group appeared to have some degree of involvement in the 2016 Shamoon 2 attack and remains active in targeting the Arabian Gulf region and the Middle East.  Currently, the group’s primary mode of operation is to compromise IT and do reconnaissance against industrial organizations. Dragos has not seen evidence of this group having any ICS-specific capabilities that could damage critical infrastructure. But, they do target oil, gas and manufacturing companies, mostly in Europe and North America, and focus on network penetration.   “The group specializes in initial penetration – CHRYSENE compromises a target machine and passes the victim to another group for further exploitation. The group operates in Iraq, Pakistan, Israel, and the UK, and is an evolution of previous campaigns focusing exclusively on the Arabian Gulf region,” wrote Caltagirone.  Defenders might find success if they shift the focus to the \"kill chain\", said Caltagirone. \"The initial access, lateral movement, and intelligence gathering process which takes months or years before any disruption.

Alarmingly, most of the discussion confirmed a high level of distrust for the government. Members of the private sector don't feel the government would protect them if they were attacked.  Scott Goodhart, VP and CISO, \"In our sector, we are strong with sharing information with each other. There's a level of trust there,\" Goodhart said. However, in a regulated industry, sharing is less frequent because people don't want regulators on their backs.  The problem, said renowned cybersecurity expert, Niloofar Razi Howe, is that there is an authority and capability mismatch. \"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority, but the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Security Agency (NSA) have the capability. That creates issues with communicating in real time.\"  Lack of a coordinator, clarity, policy and strategy contribute to this fissure between the public and private sectors, especially when it comes to things that only a government can do.  \"Deterrence policy is unique to the government,\" said Razi Howe. Short of policies that deter any type of cyber malfeasance, organizations can't protect themselves. Not only is the US without deterrence policies, but panel members agreed there is no real comprehensive conversation about what the current administration is doing in its cybersecurity strategy.  Daniel Ennis, head of threat intelligence, Still, there is confusion about who is in charge, and the elimination of the cybersecurity coordinator position did little to clarify that confusion. Ennis did say that the \"divisiveness downtown is not helping. Now we have to come together and collaborate.

If you answer yes, the host key will be saved in the %UserProfile%\\.ssh\\known_hosts hidden file, and when next you connect to it, you won't be asked again.  Next, you must enter the remote server's user account password. Once that's done, you're logged into the remote server, and you can program on it or run system administration tools.  Once you're done type \"exit\". You'll then get the following message: \"Connection to [server] closed.\" And you're back to your local command prompt. It's safer, however, to use key-based authentication. For that,  you must first generate client public/private key pairs. From PowerShell or cmd, you do this by using ssh-keygen to generate the key files. This is done with the following commands: cd ~\\.ssh\\ssh-keygen With my system, the output looks like: Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.Enter file in which to save the key (C:\\Users\\sjvn\\.ssh\\id_ed25519): Next, you must move your public key (~\\.ssh\\id_ed25519.pub) into a text file called authorized_keys in the directory ~\\.ssh\\ on the remote server. Private keys are like your passwords. They must be protected. On Windows, you should shield your private keys by using the ssh-agent service, as the Administrator, and use ssh-add to store your private key. Then, whenever you need it for authentication, ssh-agent will automatically retrieve it and pass it to OpenSSH. Once set up, you'll be able to securely login into remote servers and transfer files to them. You're now ready to work on remote Unix/Linux systems. Enjoy.

On Thursday, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) The 37-year-old Latvian \"non-citizen,\" -- which means a citizen of the former USSR -- who has been living in Riga, the capital of Latvia, was charged on one count of conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and one count of computer intrusion with intent to cause damage and aiding and abetting. The charges relate to Scan4You, an online service dedicated to cybercriminals and malware developers. The system could be used to see whether or not a variety of antivirus products would detect malicious code -- which is invaluable for malware developers to ascertain before they release their creations into the wild.        Bondars operated the service from 2009 to at least 2016 and offered Scan4You to hackers in return for a fee. Scan4You could be used to check a minimum of 35 commercial antivirus engines.       One customer of the service used the service to test malware which was released in order to cause chaos for US retailers. The result was the theft of roughly 40 million credit and debit card numbers, 70 million addresses, phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information (PII) from customers.

Scan4You was specifically marketed towards cybercriminals and was advertised in the more nefarious recesses of the Internet. In addition, the service allowed users to upload their files anonymously and without sharing any data with the cybersecurity community.

Speaking to Barlow called this an “unintended consequence of this privacy law” and that the end of disclosure of who owns the domain will prevent tracking the owners.  He said: “Millions of emails come in every day and we use Whois to see who sent it and block spammers, so the message doesn’t even make it in as it is blocked at the network layer. When a new domain gets registered we look at the Whois information and name and address.”  This In April, The ICANN statement said that a moratorium on enforcement action by data protection acts would potentially allow for the introduction of an agreed-upon accreditation model, and for the registries and registrars to implement the accreditation model in conjunction with the measures in the agreed final interim compliance model.  “A fragmented Whois would no longer employ a common framework for generic top-level domain (gTLD) registration directory services,” ICANN said. “Registries and registrars would likely implement varying levels of access to data depending on their interpretations of the law.”  Barlow explained that while a malicious registrant will not use their real name, but there will be some consistency if they register 1000 domains, so the phone number or email would be the same “and when we detect one we can flag them all as bad, and this proliferates across the internet in minutes.”  Barlow said that losing the ability to know who registered a domain will hit the efficacy of malicious domain takedowns, and this could lead to two bad scenarios: one is where the amount of spam and attacks go up and companies block everything, including those who legitimately want to keep their details private; and the second issue will be more spam carrying malicious links or ransomware.  “This gives bad guys a free reign, as most domains are malicious,” Barlow said. “We need to filter them out, and the only way is with Whois.”  He concluded by saying that the cybersecurity industry can get in front of this, and monitor new domains and their activity “as bad guys register domains anonymously and wait a few months so test it, put legit traffic on it and then flip it to be malicious.”  However, we can expect a lot of spam in a few months with no way to block it. “Ironically the new privacy law could cause further loss through cyber-attack.” \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

Minutes before the exploits were used in the wild, IP addresses in Latvia checked the security vendor’s web reputation system to see if it blocked the URLs hosting the exploits.  After investigating further, the vendor said it noticed that those IP addresses were not only checking g01pack’s exploit URLs but many others.  According to a new report,“In this case our global threat intelligence network and team of researchers proved an invaluable resource for the FBI as it honed-in on this notorious CAV service,” said chief cybersecurity officer, Ed Cabrera. “This is a big blow to cybercrime, helping to disrupt countless threat actors and prove there are consequences to their actions.

The findings seemed to suggest that the rate of security issues increases with greater penetration of BYOD.  Some 40% of microbusinesses with up to 10 staff have such a policy, and 14% reported a security incident. But 51% of businesses with 51-100 people and 69% of firms with 101-250 employees allowed BYOD, and their figures for security incidents stood at 70% and 94% respectively.  The most common incidents over the past 12 months were malware-related (65%), followed by viruses (42%), distributed denial of service (26%), data theft (24%) and phishing (23%).  The findings highlight the challenge facing firms with fewer resources to spend on IT security, of how to enable more productive ways of working without exposing themselves to greater cyber-risk.  Paymentsense head of digital, Chafic Badr, argued that firms need to have \"As with all cybersecurity issues, the biggest factor is the human one — employees need to be aware of their responsibilities and the risks associated with a BYOD system. This is particularly important when you consider personal data responsibilities in the post-GDPR landscape,” he added.  “If mistakes are made, having an incident response plan clarifies responsibilities and ensures the timely action is taken to contain and control the situation.”  The findings chime with a recent      \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 A new variant of the Mirai botnet has added at least three exploits to its arsenal, which enable it to target additional IoT devices, including routers and DVRs.

The web giant explained in a blog post at the end of last week that “users should expect that the web is safe by default,” and so will only be told in future if they site they’re visiting is not secure.  “Since we’ll soon start marking all HTTP pages as ‘not secure’, we’ll step towards removing Chrome’s positive security indicators so that the default unmarked state is secure. Chrome will roll this out over time, starting by removing the ‘Secure’ wording and HTTPS scheme in September 2018 (Chrome 69),” wrote Chrome Security product manager, “Previously, HTTP usage was too high to mark all HTTP pages with a strong red warning, but in October 2018 (Chrome 70), we’ll start showing the red ‘not secure’ warning when users enter data on HTTP pages.”  The move could confuse consumers looking out for a padlock in the short term, but ultimately should be seen as a positive move in forcing businesses to improve the security of their sites, argued “However, as we’ve already seen from the depreciation of SHA-1 certificates, organizations are typically slow to react to warnings of this kind and can often underestimate the task at hand. Many organizations do not properly track which certificates they have applied where, and have thousands of certificates that they are unaware of,” he added.     “Just the task of discovering these and making sure they are upgraded to HTTPS will be a big task and, if done manually, there are likely to be gaps which cause disruption to customers and business processes. This is why businesses need to take control of their security and use automation to enable them to be agile in applying new changes such as switching from HTTP to HTTPS certificates.”    \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 A rapidly evolving information-stealing malware campaign has added iOS device phishing and cryptocurrency mining to its arsenal, having previously just focused on Android targets.

An old command injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-6277) is exploited via Port 8443 to compromise Netgear R7000 and R6400 devices.  For Port 80, the black hats have added a technique which hijacks compromised web servers with malicious web shells already installed.  “After a successful exploit, this bot then downloads its payload from a malicious website, in this case, hxxp://185.246.152.173/exploit/owari.{extension}. This makes it obvious that it aims to download the Owari bot, another Mirai variant, instead of the previously hinted at Sora bot,” explained “However, at the time of analysis, the Owari bot samples could no longer be found in the website directory. In another turn of events, it turns out that they have been replaced by the samples shown below, which were later found to be the Omni bot.”  In fact, it is believed that the same author, who used the pseudonym “Wicked” in an interview last April is responsible for Owari, Sora, Omni and Wicked.  “This also leads us to the conclusion that while the Wicked bot was originally meant to deliver the Sora botnet, it was later repurposed to serve the author’s succeeding projects,” the researchers argued.    \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

John Kelsey Gammell pleaded guilty on January 17, to one count of conspiracy to cause intentional damage to a protected computer and two counts of being a felon-in-possession of a firearm.  He was sentenced late last week to 180 months behind bars, plus restitution to his victims to be decided at a later date.  Those victims include companies Gammell used to work for, companies that chose not to hire him, competitors of his business, law enforcement agencies and courts.  Washburn Computer Group, the Minnesota State Courts, Dakota County Technical College, Minneapolis Community and Technical College, and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office were just some of those whose websites he targeted.  Between July 2015 and March 2017 he’s said to have launched attacks from his own computer and via multiple DDoS-as-a-service offerings on roughly three dozen target websites.  Gammell also used IP address anonymization services, crypto-currency to pay for “DDoS-for-hire” services, and fake email accounts to hide his identity, as well as encryption and drive-cleaning tools to conceal digital evidence on his machines at home,Despite being a convicted felon, Gammell possessed several handguns and AR-15 assault rifle parts, which helped to bump up his sentencing further still.

The apps are also able to steal device-related data. \t\tMcAfee believes that AppLockFree, in particular, is part of a reconnaissance stage, especially as the app then attempts to lure the user to spread it further on social media, such as to Facebook contacts and friends. \t\tOnce a victim's device is infected with a malicious application, embedded malware then uses Dropbox and Yandex to upload information and issue commands -- the same technique used in the past by the threat actors. \t\tThe researchers uncovered information logs from these cloud storage sites which suggests the same test Android devices are also being used to develop these malicious apps. \t\tAndroid devices used to test the malware's functionality have been manufactured in different countries. However, all of them carry installed Korean apps and use modified versions of publicly available sandbox escape, privilege escalation, and code execution exploits which bolt-on additional functionality to the RedDawn Trojans. \t\t\"The modified exploits suggest that the attackers are not skillful enough to find zero-days and write their own exploits,\" the researchers say. \"However, it is likely just a matter of time before they start to exploit vulnerabilities.\" \t\tAn extensive investigation into the threat group's operations uncovered different versions of the malware, which appears to have become active back in 2017. \t\tFurthermore, the email addresses used by the new malware's developers are identical to earlier addresses associated with Sun Team. \t\tThe malicious apps point to North Korean IP addresses but attempt to appear South Korean by naming systems based on popular celebrity names in the country. However, the awkward use of South Korean vocabulary suggests that while the operators are familiar with South Korea's culture, they are not native speakers. \t\tMany elements of the RedDawn campaign are the same as the techniques employed in January. However, McAfee has also discovered a new and disturbing trend -- the use of stolen pictures.  Images taken from social networks are being used to create individual, fake South Korean accounts to spread the malware. \t\t\tThere is also evidence that some of those who have had their pictures taken have also had their entire identities stolen. Text and calling services based on these stolen profiles are being used to sign up for South Korean online services, which may further propagate the malware. \t\t\"These elements are suggestive, though not a confirmation, of the nationality of the actors behind these malware campaigns,\" McAfee added. \t\tThe apps were uploaded to Google Play as \"unreleased\" versions. Following the cybersecurity firm's report, the mobile applications were only able to infect approximately 100 devices before being removed.

This has allowed the ICO to “develop, to grow and reinvent ourselves.” This has seen a “fundamental” series of changes at the ICO including its mission in transparency in digital economy, recruitment, funding and its approach to technology with its new Byers went on to say that the ICO will “not be changing our approach to fines in four days time,” but its aim is to prevent harm, and put support and compliance at the heart of its regulatory action.   While voluntary compliance is the preferred route, she said that action will be taken where necessary and this will be backed up with “hefty fines” which can be levied on those who organizations who persistently, deliberately or negligently flout the law.  In conclusion, Byers said that its “If I had to sum up the impact of GDPR in one word, it would be people,” she said. “This is all about individuals, balancing the law and increasing the public’s trust and confidence in the way their data is handled.” \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                  Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

Well you conduct your data protection impact assessment over the technology.”  She agreed that it is “very robust and secure and unlikely to be encountering challenges” regarding loss of personal data, but how does it sit with data retention?  From a regulatory perspective, Heward-Mills acknowledged that there is no central regulation required, but is it desired? In terms of how GDPR applies to Blockchain, she asked the audience if encrypted data and metadata is still considered to be personal information?  “Where there are decentralized systems, how does the legislation actually apply? Is it still fit for purpose?”  Looking at the key principles, she rated Blockchain against the principles of Heward-Mills said that with the GDPR, privacy by design was one of central pillars but with Blockchain, it is decentralized, everyone has a ledger and how is it possible to regulate in a decentralized way of operating?  She acknowledged that there is an “opportunity to shape the approach of supervisory authorities in this context” as the regulators were still figuring out how to work with such technology.  Following on with the role of the DPO in this, she said there will be a critical role in shaping how the regulators respond to this emerging technology, but what we can offer “is the voice of corporate reality and challenges that are presented in using this technology.”  She said: “This is a really exciting time. Given that the regulator wants to receive perspectives from practitioners, I think we have a real opportunity to shape the future of this technology.”  Concluding, Heward-Mills said that there is some uncertainty on how it is evolving and how it is being regulated, but it is growing in importance and there will be more discussion on how it is applied.  “It is not always anonymous and it is possible through different data sets to decode on use and individuals behind the ledger and either we need to find some exemption in terms of how Blockchain is perceived, and its application under data protection laws, but the law needs to be updated as there are certain principles that are so incompatible fundamentally.”  \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                  \t                     Get rid of the sticky notes and get peace of mind.

While banks are well armed against external attacks with strong perimeter protections, they remain susceptible to insider threats, according to the report. \"Whether by puncturing the perimeter with social engineering, vulnerabilities in web applications, or the help of insiders, as soon as attackers access the internal network, they find friendly terrain that is secured no better than companies in other industries,\" Positive Technologies wrote in a Using techniques similar to those of the Cobalt gang, known for its attacks on financial institutions, penetration testers compromised the workstations used for ATM management at one-quarter (25%) of the banks tested.   The report also noted that during the reconnaissance stage of collecting information about the target, many criminals search for malicious insider on web forums. These unscrupulous insiders are willing to share company information for a fee. Using stolen credentials and phishing campaigns are the most common and effective techniques criminals use to access banks because \"it is both difficult and risky to organize attacks on servers or web applications, since the attackers are very likely to get caught,\" the report said.  Vulnerabilities in web applications leaves many banks at risk. Still, remote access is another dangerous feature that often leaves the door open to access by external users. \"The most common types are the SSH and Telnet protocols, which are present on the network perimeter of over half of banks, as well as protocols for file server access, found at 42 percent of banks,\" the report said.  \"The good news is that it's possible to stop an attack and prevent loss of funds at any stage, as long as the attack is detected in time and appropriate measures are taken,\" said Leigh-Anne Galloway, cybersecurity resilience lead at Positive Technologies, in the press release.  \"Attachments should be scanned in a sandbox, without depending on endpoint antivirus solutions.

That information could be grabbed from a discarded bill or obtained from an email. In any case, a determined attacker could simply guess the house or apartment number.         The site returned the Wi-Fi name and password -- in plaintext -- used to connect to the network for one of the customers who uses an Xfinity router. The other customer was using his own router -- and the site didn't return the Wi-Fi network name or password.       The bug returns data even if the Xfinity Wi-Fi is already switched on. Even when the Wi-Fi password changes, running the details again will return the new Wi-Fi password. There appears to be no way for customers to opt out when using Xfinity hardware. Saini said that it would be difficult but not impossible to enumerate account numbers.  Although it's not believed the sensitive data can be used to access the router's settings, an attacker could use the information to access the Wi-Fi network within its range.

The Intel calls this a Another new but less dangerous Spectre-style security hole is With this, local users may be able to get unauthorized disclosure of system parameters via a side-channel analysis. External attacks, via a web browser processing a malicious payload, are less likely with both these problems according to Intel. That's because, Intel states, \"Most leading browser providers have recently deployed mitigations in their Managed Runtimes -- mitigations that substantially increase the difficulty of exploiting side channels in a modern web browser. These techniques would likewise increase the difficulty of exploiting a side channel in a browser based on SSB.\" To fix the problem, Intel has released beta microcode updates to operating system vendors, equipment manufacturers, and other ecosystem partners adding support for Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD). SSBD provides additional protection by blocking Speculative Store Bypass from occurring.  Intel hopes  most major operating system and hypervisors will add support for Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) starting as early as May 21, 2018. This update also addresses Rogue System Register Read (RSRR). It does this by ensuring that RDMSR instructions will not speculatively return data under certain conditions.  No operating system or hypervisor changes are required to support this patch. Other operating system vendors will be issuing patches shortly. How bad is it? Red Hat rates it as Important. That seems about right to me. It would take a local user and some effort to exploit this hole, but it's perfectly doable.  It's worth keeping in mind that a \"local\" user doesn't have to be someone logged into a server. For example, who's the \"local\" user on a container?  Red Hat states, \"Every Linux container includes a Linux base layer. For these containers to be used in production environments, it is important that this content is free from known vulnerabilities. If the container includes a kernel, virtualization components, or other components listed below, they should be updated. Once updated, there are no container-specific related actions that need to be taken unless the container has dependencies upon or includes the affected packages. The following files must be updated: kernel, kernel-rt,libvirt, qemu-kvm-rhev, openjdk, microcode_clt, and linux_firmware.\" As Chris Robinson, Red Hat's Manager of Product Security Assurance, said, \"This vulnerability (CVE-2018-3639) is the latest example of flaws discovered by a recent focus on the fundamental elements of modern computing, vulnerabilities that cross numerous hardware and software platforms. While the flaws require a sophisticated attacker to exploit, customers should act quickly to apply both hardware and software updates to reduce the risk of exploitation.\" Robinson's right.

On Monday, the UK information watchdog said the fine was the first issued to a university under the Under the UK's current data protection rules, controllers of information -- such as the university -- are required to take reasonable steps to protect data.  However, The conference was held in the then devolved University's Computing and Mathematics School. A microsite was dedicated to the training event which logged information from both staff and students -- and this website was not secured or closed down afterward.        Three years later, threat actors exploited a vulnerability in the domain to access areas of the web server. As a result, information including names, addresses, and telephone numbers belonging to 19,500 people including students, staff, and alumni was compromised. To make matters worse, data belonging to roughly 3,500 of these individuals and exposed through the server included sensitive information such as details on sickness, learning difficulties, and \"extenuating circumstances,\" according to the regulator.       This information was then leaked online. \"Students and members of staff had a right to expect that their personal information would be held securely and this serious breach would have caused significant distress,\" said Steve Eckersley, Head of Enforcement at the ICO. \"The nature of the data and the number of people affected have informed our decision to impose this level of fine.\" The ICO's investigation revealed that the microsite was developed without the university -- as an institution -- knowing at the time, as the department was devolved. However, this does not remove the university's overall responsibility. The ICO believes that appropriate technical and management systems were not in place which would be defined as \"reasonable\" data protection efforts. Therefore, the fine was imposed. With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) deadline of 25 May 2018 only days away, consequences in the future for lax security and poor data protection will become more strict. However, the journey has already shown itself to be a difficult one for organizations.

The stolen PII included the contact details of 19,500 people such as names, addresses and telephone numbers. For around 3,500 of these people, much more sensitive data including information on extenuating circumstances, details of learning difficulties and staff sickness records was also taken and subsequently posted online.  That will certainly have increased the size of the fine significantly, as the ICO takes a dim view of organizations that fail to protect data which, if leaked, could cause significant distress to the individual.  The ICO claimed Greenwich University didn’t have the technical and organizational measures in place to ensure a breach would not occur.  The university is just lucky the incident happened in 2016 rather than next week, when the GDPR will empower the ICO to levy even higher fines if it chooses.  ”Whilst the microsite was developed in one of the university’s departments without its knowledge, as a data controller it is responsible for the security of data throughout the institution,” said ICO head of enforcement, “Students and members of staff had a right to expect that their personal information would be held securely and this serious breach would have caused significant distress.

The 18-year-old student from Uruguay's University of the Republic discovered a critical remote code execution (RCE) bug in the system, which is a framework and cloud platform used for the hosting and development of web applications in Google data centers. Every Google App Engine (GAE) application replies to HTTP requests with an \"X-Cloud-Trace-Context\" header. Appengine.google.com runs on GAE, and after some exploration, the researcher learned how GAE apps perform internal actions, including log writing and retrieving OAuth tokens. However, in the Java 8 environment, internal actions were performed by sending Protocol Buffer (PB) messages to an internal HTTP endpoint. The response would be the corresponding PB message that represents the reply from the API, or an error message.        Security tickets could also be generated with crafted lines of code. \"Since this endpoint has access to some internal stuff, I was sure this must be related to whatever \"appengine.google.com\" uses for performing internal actions, but I could not find anything in the HTTP endpoint,\" the researcher explained.       The bug hunter then went on to upload a statically linked version of Nmap to GAE. This led to the discovery that port four was open, and after building a C++ client and running it on GAE, the researcher uncovered a gRPC service which was running an \"apphosting.APIHost\" API. It seemed at this stage that the actions performed by the appengine domain were invoking hidden APIs. The researcher then created a Java library in C++ which reads arguments passed to launchers before returning them, leading to the discovery of API names including \"logservice\" and \"stubby.\" Through these scripts, the researcher was able to gain access to the staging and test GAE deployment environments, which are usually restricted and cannot be accessed by standard users. A few tweaks to the gRPC client allowed the bug hunter to access stubby.  \"After discovering this, I did some testing, but I was not able to find any stubby call that I considered dangerous,\" the researcher says. \"Nevertheless, I reported this to Google and it got a P1 priority.\" However, exploration continued, leading to the discovery of additional internal APIs including \"app_config_service.\" These findings were also reported and Google asked the researcher to stop -- as there was a real risk that any more investigations into the APIs could break the system. The university student was then awarded the large bounty for what Google considers a severe RCE bug. \"I was not aware until then that this was regarded as Remote Code Execution (The highest tier for bugs), it was a very pleasant surprise,\" the researcher added. \"I asked one of the Googlers in the reward panel about it, and he told me it is RCE for the way Google works and also that the extra $5k (Since they pay $31,337 for RCE bugs) was for a lesser bug.\" The initial report was made on 25 February. Google confirmed the findings and patched the security issue on May 16, 2018.

Researchers at the Once again, the findings are based on representative samples of items of expenditure in each organization and whether incorrect payments are the result of error or fraud. In total, it reviewed 600 loss measurement exercises related to £15.6 trillion of expenditure in 40 sectors globally.  Fraud is costing the global economy £3.2 trillion annually, and in the UK stands at £110bn.  Although this is a drop from Since 2008, there has been a massive rise of 49.5% in average losses, that amounts to 6.8% of total expenditure over the period.  Head of forensic and counter fraud at Crowe, Clark and Whitehill, Jim Gee, has told In addition, a Crowe, Clark and Whitehill argued that visibility into the problem is a vital first step towards mitigating fraud risk.  “It is also the case that work to measure losses is highly cost-effective,” it said. “Efforts to reduce losses are helped by greater knowledge about the scale of the problem. The data shows that organizations which re-measure the same area of expenditure have consistently lower loss rates.” \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Intel's upcoming microcode updates to address the Intel has anticipated questions about performance this time around by confirming upfront that its combined software and firmware microcode updates to mitigate Spectre variant 4 will cause a performance impact of up to eight percent.  \"If enabled, we've observed a performance impact of approximately two to eight percent based on overall scores for benchmarks like SYSmark® 2014 SE and SPEC integer rate on client and server test systems,\" Spectre variant 4 is a new subclass of speculative execution attacks discovered by Intel calls the Spectre attack a Speculative Store Bypass and calls its mitigation Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD), which is delivered as a microcode update to operating system vendors, equipment manufacturers, and other ecosystem partners.   Intel in January was less forthcoming in its communications about the performance impact caused by its mitigations for Spectre variant 2, only saying it would vary depending on the workload. However, Google found the impact to be significant and Intel's current benchmarking to test the impact of SSBD was run on unspecified Intel reference hardware and an 8th Generation Intel Core desktop microprocessor.  The performance impact is four percent in the SYSmark 2014 SE overall score, two percent under the SPECint_rate_base2006 (n copy) total score, and eight percent in the SPECint_rate_base2006 (1 copy) total score.    The impact on a Skylake architecture Xeon processor is similar under these benchmarks.  But unlike Intel's updates for variant 2, the updates for Spectre variant 4, which is rated as a 'moderate'-severity issue and closely related to Spectre variant 1, will be optional and will by-default set to off. In this state, there is no impact on performance.  \"We've already delivered the microcode update for variant 4 in beta form to OEM system manufacturers and system software vendors, and we expect it will be released into production BIOS and software updates over the coming weeks,\" wrote Culbertson. \"This mitigation will be set to off by default, providing customers the choice of whether to enable it. We expect most industry software partners will likewise use the default-off option. In this configuration, we have observed no performance impact.\" As Intel notes in its advisory, \"SSBD provides additional protection by providing a means for system software to completely inhibit a Speculative Store Bypass from occurring if desired.\"  In other words, if consumers and OEMs want their hardware to be extra secure they can choose that option at the expense of performance.  Intel also notes that already-released browser mitigations against Spectre variant 1 do help mitigate variant 4.   AMD similarly recommends leaving SSBD disabled.  Reports are emerging of eight new 'Spectre-class' security CPU vulnerabilities. A new variant of Spectre can expose the contents of memory that normally can't be accessed by the OS kernel. Microsoft releases new Windows updates to address the Spectre variant 2 flaw affecting Intel chips. AMD has released microcode updates for Spectre variant 2 that require Microsoft's latest Windows 10 patch. A handful of CPU families that Intel was due to patch will now forever remain vulnerable. Intel has listed a range of CPUs released between 2007 and 2011 that will not receive a firmware update to help guard against Spectre-related exploits. Since the beginning of 2018, the number of cases has risen from three to 32.                            Microsoft has announced it will extend the rights available to Europeans under the EU's new privacy regulation to all consumers across the world.  The General Data Protection Regulation comes into effect this Friday, introducing a range of new Data Subject Rights for EU residents, such as the right to obtain data a company has collected, and to request the deletion of data if the user no longer consents to a company holding it.  Consumers also have the right to take data to another service provider, and to know how a company is processing their data.  Rather than enabling these rights only for European consumers, Microsoft will provide them to all consumers.         \"As an EU regulation, GDPR creates important new rights specifically for individuals in the European Union. But we believe GDPR establishes important principles that are relevant globally,\" \"We will extend the rights that are at the heart of GDPR to all our consumer customers worldwide.\"       Facebook in April However, the company also said it would offer the same privacy controls and settings available to Europeans under GDPR to the rest of the world.  Microsoft-owned LinkedIn in May Microsoft has updated its privacy statement with new language required by GDPR and to reflect its promise to offer all users the same access rights as its EU users have.  \"If Microsoft obtained your consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time,\" \"You can request access to, erasure of, and updates to your personal data; and if you'd like to port your data elsewhere, you can use tools Microsoft provides to do so, or if none are available, you can contact Microsoft for assistance.\" The statement also clarifies that users can object to or restrict Microsoft's use of personal data for direct-marketing purposes or if Microsoft is \"pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party\".    \"You may have these rights under applicable laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but we offer them regardless of your location,\" Microsoft states.  Google has also Google is also rolling out its Family Link Android app to all countries within the EU. Until now the Family Link service Google will be emailing millions of its users to tell them about its redesigned privacy policy.

Among those were “persons in need, and, where applicable, their reported abusers, including graphic descriptions of elder abuse, child abuse, and suicidal distress, raising serious, large-scale privacy concerns,” according to UpGuard.  The information, stored in an Amazon AWS S3 bucket located at the subdomain “lacounty,” was inadvertently misconfigured to be publicly and anonymously accessible, according to UpGuard. “Though some of the files in the bucket were not publicly downloadable, those that were included Postgres database backups and CSV exports of that data, with hundreds of thousands of rows of sensitive personal information,” the UpGuard post stated.  While the leak itself is not remarkable in size, the exposed information is highly sensitive, and is possibly the ultimate example of how important it is to know if the service you're using is risk-appropriate for the information being stored, said Sam Bisbee, CSO,    “When you see an organization expose such sensitive data, it should serve as a reminder that companies must maintain an understanding of whether the service they use is risk-appropriate for the type of data they store there,” Bisbee said.  While UpGuard made efforts to contact 211 LA County after their 14 March analysis that revealed the sensitive information was accessible, they were not able to connect with a member of the 211 LA County information security team until 24 April.     UpGuard confirmed that after only 24 hours, the bucket was no longer publicly accessible. “Amazon S3 access rules can be set for both the bucket as a whole and for the files within it. In the case of the “lacounty” bucket, permission settings allowed anyone to list the contents; some of the files inside, however, had additional rules preventing public users from downloading them,” the UpGuard post said.     Threat Stack research indicates that nearly three-quarters of companies have critical AWS cloud security misconfigurations. “So, every reported cloud data leak is a lesson to companies that they need to proactively find ways to create transparency within their cloud infrastructure so that they can effectively manage the security of their data and systems,” Bisbee said.          \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) comes into forces this week - on May 25 - but 57 percent of employees still don't know what they are supposed to do to protect personal data, according to a OnePoll survey of 1,000 employees undertaken for London-based Tony Pepper, Egress CEOTony Pepper, Egress's CEO, said in a The survey suggests that only 42 percent of employees had been provided with ways to share personal information safely, \"such as email encryption, encrypted file transfer or secure project collaboration tools\". However, 20 percent \"admitted to using personal apps or web services to share company documents. Unsurprisingly, personal email led the charge on this with 12 percent of respondents choosing it as one way to quickly share documents, while other answers included social media (seven percent), messaging apps (seven percent) and personal clouds (three percent),\" says Egress.  \"This behaviour puts personal data at higher risk of unauthorised access and makes the organisation liable for a data breach under GDPR.\"        Marketing departments are the worst offenders because these employees are most likely to handle personal data (96 percent of marketing respondents) and most likely to use social media accounts (70 percent). According to the UK's Data posted or faxed to incorrect recipient;  Loss or theft of paperwork; Data sent by email to incorrect recipient;  Failure to redact data; Failure to use bcc when sending email. One approach is to provide an encrypted email and file transfer system, which is one of the things Egress is selling. Egress Switch can be cloud hosted on on-premise. While companies pay a subscription to send encrypted messages and files, it's free to recipients, via web browsers or Organisations that use Office 365 can also use Office Online securely inside Egress's Egress told ZDNet: \"We're not advocating replacing email or fundamentally changing the way people work - we know from past precedent that typically that's not going to be a successful approach! Users simply want to get their jobs done, so security tools must enable them to both be productive and secure personal data.\" Another idea is to use Egress says that \"emails can be scanned against DLP policies to force encryption of messages and attachments should users forget to do so, and machine learning can be used to highlight when an incorrect recipient has been added to an email. In this way, we can take the tools and processes staff are used to working with to help them continue doing their jobs but also avoid putting personal data at risk.\" But every technology solution must be backed up with education and training. Pepper says: \"Awareness is a huge part of compliance: everyone who handles personal data should be able to identify and protect it. Organizations need to be doing all they can to provide staff with security safety nets that prevent data breaches.

Across the nation, about 20% of registered voters use paperless machines. While election officials are on board with upgrading these systems, they do say that the machines are accurate, according to the \"In many jurisdictions, the multimillion-dollar cost is a hurdle,\" the \"In Georgia, the cost to switch to paper-based machines in the state’s 159 counties ranges from $25 million to more than $100 million, depending on the technology adopted,\" the But issues with voting accuracy are not exclusive to statewide elections.

In the time remaining before the midterms, that could mean having everyone cast a paper absentee ballot as one means of achieving this goal in the short term.\"  There are also varying options for long term solutions based on examples from other states. \"The primary vulnerability is the ability to alter votes cast via DREs without a paper record to audit or otherwise verify the electronic voting records. Other vulnerabilities include the manner in which [Georgia] has stored voter registration information and the ability to access and even alter that information in ways that could affect the election. For example, a hacker could change assigned polling locations for certain voters to create confusion when they go to vote and effectively prevent them from voting,” Cross said.       \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Let's face it folks: Security can be \"too inconvenient\" and when your boss doesn't want to adhere to your security policy it's going to be difficult to enforce.

Spectre is a flaw that an attacker can exploit to force a CPU to reveal its data.”  Rob Tate, distinguished security researcher at The vulnerabilities were assigned    \"If an attacker has access to run code on a machine, there are already a number of simpler (and more universal) techniques to try before resorting to this, and it’s far from the wide-reaching implications of the original Spectre. So, while patches should be applied when possible, Intel is right to call this a Medium,\" said Tate.   The more commonly useful a vulnerability, the more it helps attackers simplify their process; thus, the easier it becomes for non-skilled hackers to compromise more computers.  In an industry where people are trained to expect speed, it's not uncommon to see the vast majority of people choose speed over security, said Renaud Deraison, co-founder and CTO of “In this case,\" continued Deraison, \"the vulnerabilities take advantage of the very features that make them fast.

Between January 2017 and February 2018, Tencent Keen Security Lab researchers conducted tests with various BMW models, with a focus on the head unit and T-Box components.  After 13 months of research, the team discovered 14 vulnerabilities which could place connected cars at risk of compromise. The tests were conducted with BMW's backing and in laboratory conditions. Impacted vehicles are included in the automaker's i Series, X1 sDrive, 5 Series, and 7 Series. In total, as documented in The vulnerabilities permitted attackers to access the head unit -- otherwise known as the infotainment system -- and T-box components including the Telematics Control Unit and Central Gateway Module of the vehicles involved in the tests, leading to the creation and deployment of exploit chains designed to seize control of CAN buses. The exposure of CAN buses to attack is a serious issue considering that these buses connect all of a car's functions. Once the CAN buses were under attacker control, the researchers were able to trigger arbitrary diagnostic functions remotely.       Keen Security Lab also came across memory corruption vulnerabilities, logic errors, bugs which could break secure isolation system areas, and vulnerabilities which could lead to remote code execution. The team was also able to compromise the car physically through exploiting USB, Ethernet, and OBD-II connections. \"With network drivers, the USB-Ethernet network will be enabled when a USB dongle with some specific chipsets plugged in,\" the report states. \"[The] NBT head unit will act as a network gateway with a fixed IP address (192.168.0.1). What's worse, there aren't any security restrictions to such USB Ethernet Interface, which makes it possible to obtain access to the internal network of the head unit, and then detect many exposed internal services through port scanning.\" Furthermore, it was possible to use a USB stick to implement a crafted, malicious update file able to compromise the update service and gain root control of hu-Intel, a system which controls multimedia services and BMW ConnectedDrive functionality. Once Keen Security Lab's findings were verified, measures were developed to patch some of the most critical issues. These upgrades have been rolled out to backend systems and uploaded to telematics control units via over-the-air (OTA) updates. Additional software updates will be made available at dealerships. The current research does omit the most crucial technical elements of exploits in order to prevent cyberattackers abusing weaknesses in BMW security before the company resolves all of the vulnerabilities mentioned. However, both parties plan to publish a more substantial account of the security flaws, exploit chains, and the ways they have been resolved in 2019.   \"In response to what has become a race between technological progress and new, presently unknown attack scenarios, the BMW Group has launched a comprehensive cybersecurity action plan, which includes tests conducted both internally by the BMW Group and with the help of independent institutions,\" the company said. \"Third parties increasingly play a crucial role in improving automotive security as they conduct their own in-depth tests of products and services.\" Due to the success of the initiative, Tencent Keen Security Lab and BMW are currently discussing options for new cybersecurity research collaboration.  Future research proposals will focus on Google Android embedded vehicle systems, as well as autonomous driving, testing, and the security of OTA update mechanisms. Mozilla has added support for two-factor authentication in Firefox Accounts, its login system for syncing bookmarks, passwords, and open tabs across desktop and mobile devices.  Mozilla will allow Firefox Accounts users to opt in to its two-step authentication setup from today as part of a phased rollout, The standard it's chosen to implement is TOTP, or Time-based One-Time Passwords, which can be generated using several authenticator apps.  Mozilla's The quickest way for Firefox Accounts users to set it up is by going to Menu/Options/Firefox Account/Manage accounts, and then clicking the 'Enable' button next to the two-step authentication panel.  Mozilla says if the two-step authentication section isn't yet visible, you can add 'showTwoStepAuthentication=true' to the URL and refresh the page.       Once enabled, an authenticator app can be used to scan the QR code displayed, which confirms the device and enables TOTP. At this stage, Firefox Accounts also displays recovery codes that Mozilla stresses should be downloaded and saved in a safe location.  From this point on, users will need to enter a six-digit security code every time they wish to log in.    There's some interesting background to how the Firefox Accounts team arrived at TOTP, which wasn't its first choice.  Mozilla was initially intending to implement two-factor authentication using push notifications sent to the Firefox mobile app.  Firefox Account developers thought this approach would get higher adoption more quickly, as users wouldn't need to install an authenticator app, and probably already had the Firefox mobile browser installed.  However, some users took offense to this idea, because it could appear that Mozilla was using security to nudge mobile users to enable push notifications for marketing purposes.  And as one user pointed out, for those who don't use Firefox mobile, installing Firefox mobile is a greater burden than installing an authenticator app.  \"Um, aren't there a gazillion more desktop users than mobile users?\" the individual asked. \"Isn't having me install a browser a much, much, much bigger ask than having me install a little TOTP tool? On Android, Firefox Mobile is 44MB, lots of permissions; Google Authenticator is 4MB, almost no permissions.\" But by that time the Firefox Accounts team had already been developing the TOTP option, which would go live by the second quarter of 2018.  Despite this development, Alex Davis, a product manager for Firefox Accounts defended the push-on-mobile plan and thinks TOTP adoption will remain low in the foreseeable future. \"Think of it in the context that a large proportion of our Firefox Account users already have our mobile browser installed,\" \"We can enable safe 2FA for a huge proportion of our existing users without having them install any app. Rather than hope that one day at most 10 percent of users will adopt TOTP, we can guarantee that a MUCH greater proportion of users would have MFA enabled.\" Though Davis admitted that for users who don't have mobile Firefox installed yet, it would be more effort than installing an authenticator app.  Mozilla is Mozilla is allowing Firefox Accounts users to opt in to two-step authentication as part of a phased rollout.Popular password manager LastPass delivers the first iOS app with support for the YubiKey NEO hardware-based authentication key with NFC support. Firefox becomes first browser to support the Web Authentication API, taking the world closer to no-password logins. Firefox users will soon start to see sponsored stories in new tabs, but Mozilla says it will respect users' privacy.

However, as an attack type, mobile attacks comprised just 6% of the whole, linked to over 8,000 rogue apps in Q1. Some 82% of fraudulent e-commerce transactions spotted by RSA originated from a new device in Q1 2018, indicating the lengths scammers are going to in order to avoid detection.  RSA also confirmed the increasing role of legitimate social networks in unwittingly helping fraudsters to sell their wares.  “Social media provides the perfect control station for cyber-criminals, who can easily create profiles using fake details to operate on the platforms before collaborating with other fraudsters in closed groups, or peddling stolen wares in online marketplaces,” explained RSA Fraud  Risk Intelligence Unit director, Daniel Cohen.  “Social media’s scalability, anonymity and reach is providing cyber-criminals with the perfect disguise; they can jump between accounts and devices at will, rarely using the same device twice. This makes it much easier to dodge the authorities and continue scamming.”  The firm noted that Reddit has worked to ban a number of sub-reddits dedicated to fraud, where hackers were apparently exchanging contacts and advertising services and sharing info on which dark web fraud forums to use.

One App takes Okta's enterprise-level IT products and exposes the underlying service layer, Alex Salazar, VP of Okta's developer platform, explained to ZDNet. An organization can assemble those products any way they want. Those products include multi-factor authentication, social authentication, centralized identity management and more.  \"We're doing our part to give these organizations the Lego blocks they need to assemble this stuff the right away, even if they're not experts in it,\" Salazar said.  One App is free for organizations willing to display the Okta logo when their users are going through registration or authentication.  In addition to elevating the Okta brand and furthering Okta's commitment to security, the free version also helps advance the overall objective of One App: Convincing organizations to skip the process of building their security layers.         \"Why build out your own user management system, when you don't have the time, resources or probably the skills on staff?\" Salazar asked.  Typically, smaller IT teams will build out custom security tools for their applications, Salazar said. \"Then a year or two later, when the CIO wants to solve this problem across the organization, then they go to Okta and tear out what they've already built,\" he continued. \"We're trying to disrupt that build versus buy model.\" Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

If you've read your Heinlein, you know it's an acronym for \"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.\"                       A virtual private network enables users to send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online. In this directory, we look at a few of the very best commercial VPN service providers on the Internet.                                             \tThere's always a catch. Think about Facebook. We use it for free, but in return for that attention, Facebook catalogs vast amounts of information about us, which it uses for targeted advertising. Google became one of the world's most profitable companies on the back of \"giving away\" free search (along with little ads on the side). The result was    \tTANSTAAFL.          \tAll of that brings us to VPN services. Let's do a two minute recap of what a VPN is, first. VPN (or Virtual Private Network) is a term used for services that allow you to encrypt your internet traffic between your computer and a destination computer on the VPN service. This is particularly necessary when using something like a hotel's open Wi-Fi service, so that other guests can't watch all your traffic and steal juicy bits, like credit card numbers and passwords.   \tI did a great    \tThat directory was a study of commercial VPN services. I limited my analysis to commercial services for a reason: TANSTAAFL.   \tThere are also many free VPN services, but I don't trust them. You probably shouldn't either.   \tHere's the thing: Running a VPN service is expensive. You need either servers and data lines, or you're paying a cloud vendor like Amazon for every bit received, sent, and stored. Either way, it costs money. So, think about this: If you're running a free VPN service, how do you pay for all that expense?   \tYou. In the back of the room. I see your hand up. \"Ads,\" you say. Yep, that's a possibility. Some free VPN services plaster ads on your browser display and sell those to whomever will pay.   \tI see another hand. \"Stolen data.\" That's a possibility, too. If you were a criminal organization or a terrorist ring, and you wanted to pick up a lot of credentials quickly, one easy way would be to open up a free VPN and wait for people to just hand you their secret information. As P.T. Barnum is    \tTASBEM. In other words, TANSTAAFL.   \tOK, one more. \"Lead in for upgrade sales.\" Yeah, that works, too. Some vendors will offer a small amount of free access and when you eat up that bandwidth, they'll ask you to upgrade. Try before you buy is a proven method for selling services, it's perfectly legitimate, and it's often good for both the vendor and the customer.   \tYou may also see some universities, activists, and other well-meaning groups offer free VPNs, but the problem is that they are resource constrained. That means that you're bound to see either slowdowns or stoppages because they can't afford the resources needed to provide the service. Some of those groups might also harvest information as you use their services, for use sometime in the future to further whatever their agendas might be.   \tThe bottom line, though, is this: It's just not worth risking your personal and financial data on a free VPN service. The VPN services I rated range from about $6 to $12 per month, or about $40 to $120 per year. It's usually a better deal to pay for the whole year at once.   \tThe    \tFor me, it is. I'm using a commercial VPN right now, as I write this. For the peace of mind and digital protection, it's a few bucks well spent.   \t*By the way, if you haven't read Robert Heinlein's   Whether you're in the office or on the road, a VPN is still one of the best ways to protect yourself on the big, bad internet. A virtual private network can go a long way to make sure that neither your ISP, nor anyone else, can snoop on what you do on the internet. Going mobile? Stay secure. Here's how find an effective VPN service. (Hint: You can't trust every VPN provider.) The bugs can leak real-world IP addresses, which in some cases can identify individual users and determine a user's location.               The Russian Academy of Sciences is working on a new seven-billion-ruble ($113.5-million) roadmap for Crimea’s “scientific and technical development.” The project’s main priorities include searching for groundwater (to address the peninsula’s water-supply problems), developing oil and gas deposits on Crimea’s shelf, and tackling the spread of unauthorized garbage dumps. According to the newspaper The Victorian government has announced an overhaul of the state's road safety cameras after the The announcement on Thursday sees an overhaul of the network's governance and security protocols, following a report from Road Safety Camera Commissioner John Voyage. The report, commissioned by Minister for Police Lisa Neville, and all of its recommendations will be accepted and \"fully implemented\", the state government said. According to Voyage, the virus did not affect the network's \"integrity\".  \"Our road safety camera network is integral to protecting the lives of Victorians on the road. That's why we're overhauling its security protocols to make sure we have the strongest protection in place,\" a statement from Neville said on Thursday.        \"The network deters dangerous driving and reduces road trauma, so it's crucial Victorians have faith in its integrity. \"The independent commissioner has confirmed the WannaCry virus had no impact on the network. We're not only taking action to strengthen the network's cybersecurity, but also our management operations so that it is protected against any future threats.\"       The implementation of the report's recommendations will be led by a new division created to drive the reforms, under new leadership that will report directly to Neville. A new director of the Road Safety Camera Program has also been appointed to oversee the design and delivery of the network's reconfiguration, and manage the ongoing operations of the network, the police minister said. At the time of infection, Neville revealed that the 55 initial cameras had been infected after a rogue USB was inserted by someone performing maintenance. That number eventually grew to over 159. The speed and red-light cameras initially found to be infected were operated by vehicle monitoring and enforcement service Redflix, but shortly after, Neville said investigations found additional impacted cameras were operated by Jenoptik, and noted the company did not forward the information on to authorities. Upon finding the infection, the Victorian government was quick to act, The interim report from the commissioner in July said the majority of the 54,000 fines pulled as a result of the WannaCry infection would still stand, with Voyage unequivocal that he The government said on Thursday that it has already taken early actions to \"improve the cybersecurity protocols to tighten the network so cameras are protected against the introduction of viruses from individual machines\". \"Road safety cameras save lives on our roads. The new management structure, new policies, and new security protocols will ensure Victorians can continue to have complete confidence in the integrity of the road safety camera network and the role it plays in contributing to the government's vital Towards Zero road safety campaign,\" the statement continued. Other changes to the Road Safety Camera Program will include the tightening of security so external viruses cannot spread within the network, and the establishment of a reference group between contractors and other parties that will aim to \"strengthen\" the camera network and catch issues before they occur. A review of the powers of the Road Safety Camera Commissioner to improve information sharing will also be conducted.  \t \tRadio 3AW has revealed a report from the Speed Camera Commissioner says the majority of the fines pulled after infection will be reinstated.  \t \tFor a country with a culture based on taking things as they come, Check Point has said Australia is taking the threat of cybersecurity seriously.  \t \tWannaCry caused chaos across the world.

VPNFilter malwareA new strain of malware known as VPNFilter has been found infecting at least 500,000 networking devices, mainly consumer-grade internet routers, across 54 countries. According to a \"The behaviour of this malware on networking equipment is particularly concerning, as components of the VPNFilter malware allows for theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols,\" the researchers wrote.  \"The malware has a destructive capability that can render an infected device unusable, which can be triggered on individual victim machines or en masse, and has the potential of cutting off internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide.\" Preliminary findings of the researchers indicate the VPNFilter malware overlaps with versions of the BlackEnergy malware, which was responsible for attacks that While the researchers have said that such a claim isn't definitive, they have observed VPNFilter \"actively infecting\" Ukrainian hosts, utilising a command and control infrastructure dedicated to that country. The researchers also state VPNFilter is likely state sponsored or state affiliated. As detailed by the researchers, the stage 1 malware persists through a reboot, which normal malware usually does not, with the main purpose of the first stage to gain a persistent foothold and enable the deployment of the stage 2 malware.        \"Stage 1 utilises multiple redundant command and control (C2) mechanisms to discover the IP address of the current stage 2 deployment server, making this malware extremely robust and capable of dealing with unpredictable C2 infrastructure changes,\" the researchers wrote. The stage 2 malware possesses capabilities such as file collection, command execution, data exfiltration, and device management; however, the researchers said some versions of stage 2 also possess a self-destruct capability that overwrites a critical portion of the device's firmware and reboots the device, rendering it unusable.  \"Based on the actor's demonstrated knowledge of these devices, and the existing capability in some stage 2 versions, we assess with high confidence that the actor could deploy this self-destruct command to most devices that it controls, regardless of whether the command is built into the stage 2 malware,\" the report continues. It has also been reported that there are multiple stage 3 modules that serve as plugins for the stage 2 malware, providing additional functionality.  At the time of publication, Talos said it was aware of two plugin modules: A packet sniffer for collecting traffic that passes through the device, including theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols; and a communications module that allows stage 2 to communicate over Tor.  \"We assess with high confidence that several other plugin modules exist, but we have yet to discover them,\" the researchers said.                      Cyber attacks and malware are one of the biggest threats on the internet. Learn about the different types of malware - and how to avoid falling victim to attacks.                                           \"We assess with high confidence that this malware is used to create an expansive, hard-to-attribute infrastructure that can be used to serve multiple operational needs of the threat actor.  \"Since the affected devices are legitimately owned by businesses or individuals, malicious activity conducted from infected devices could be mistakenly attributed to those who were actually victims of the actor.\" Additionally, the malware can also be used to collect data that flows through the affected device. The researchers have said VPNFilter could be used to conduct a large-scale destructive attack by using the \"kill\" command, which would render some or all of the physical devices unusable. Due to the nature of the affected devices, with the majority connected directly to the internet with no security devices or services in place, compounded by the fact that most of the affected devices already have publicly known vulnerabilities not patched by the average user with no built-in anti-malware capabilities, Talos said defending against VPNFilter is extremely difficult. \"The destructive capability particularly concerns us. This shows that the actor is willing to burn users' devices to cover up their tracks, going much further than simply removing traces of the malware,\" the researchers wrote.  \"If it suited their goals, this command could be executed on a broad scale, potentially rendering hundreds of thousands of devices unusable, disabling internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide or in a focused region where it suited the actor's purposes.\" Talos has also developed and deployed more than 100 Snort signatures for the publicly known vulnerabilities for the potentially affected devices. The researchers recommend users of small and home office-grade routers and NAS devices reset them to factory defaults and reboot them in order to remove the stage 2 and stage 3 malware, and reach out to device manufacturers to ensure up-to-date patching.

The malware itself has already infected at least 500,000 SOHO routers from Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR and TP-Link in 54 countries, as well as some QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices.  “The type of devices targeted by this actor are difficult to defend. They are frequently on the perimeter of the network, with no intrusion protection system (IPS) in place, and typically do not have an available host-based protection system such as an anti-virus (AV) package,” “We are unsure of the particular exploit used in any given case, but most devices targeted, particularly in older versions, have known public exploits or default credentials that make compromise relatively straightforward.”  The modular nature of the malware means it could be used for a number of reasons: there are capabilities to “kill” infected devices, covering the attackers’ tracks, and to steal website credentials and monitor Modbus SCADA protocols.  The group behind has created “an expansive, hard-to-attribute infrastructure that can be used to serve multiple operational needs,” such as obfuscating the source of a larger scale attack, stealing data, or launching a major destructive attack, Cisco claimed.  To help them, the attackers also created a private TOR network to improve data sharing and co-ordination of infected devices.  It’s unclear whether the campaign is linked to the joint technical alert issued by the UK and US governments The DoJ said it was actively looking to disrupt the threat.  In the meantime, Cisco urged owners of infected devices and ISPs to reset to factory default and reboot them, as well as to update patches immediately.       \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 By the end of this year, all Australians will have a My Health Record, an online record of medical information, providing they don't choose to opt out of the service. Speaking at the National Press Club on Thursday, Tim Kelsey, chief executive of the Digital Health Agency -- the One measure addressing such concerns is a cybersecurity centre that will monitor My Health Record. \"My Health Record operates to the highest cybersecurity standards in Australia and is independently audited on that basis by a number of organisations on that basis, including the Australian Signals Directorate,\" Kelsey said. \"The agency has set up a national cybersecurity centre to ensure constant, multi-layer surveillance of My Health Record ... since the system was launched in 2012, there has been no breach.\"        Another security control, Kelsey explained, is the requirement to have an access code or PIN on the individual's My Health Record. Additionally, users will be able to see a real-time audit log of who has accessed their record, and they can also set an SMS alert that notifies them of that occurrence.       Users can withhold a document from the view of their clinician, too. \"All instances of access by a clinician are attributable directly to that person and recorded in real-time,\" Kelsey said, noting that incorrect usage will be punishable via a custodial prison sentence of up to two years. \"People are quite rightly concerned over the privacy of their information, and that's why they have a right to make a choice.\" That choice is the option to opt out. Currently, more than 5.7 million Australians have a My Health Record, and those who don't want one will have \"It is essential everyone is able to make a decision on participation,\" Kelsey said. Those who don't opt out will have the record automatically created, and once the individual or a clinical professional activates it, it will start to populate with data including the last two years of their Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) information. Other information sources will only upload into the record as they happen, for example when the individual visits a GP or gets a blood test. Users can also upload their own information. Key clinical documentation will eventually be uploaded, such as pathology reports, discharge summaries from hospitals, and medications dispensed, Kelsey explained. After it is cancelled, no data will be attributed to it until its reactivated, at which time two years' worth of PBS and MBS data from that date will be re-populated. Another privacy concern is on the third-party use of My Health Record information. The government earlier this month published Direct access to or release of My Health Record data is only to an Australian entity, the guidelines state, and data released for secondary use is to be stored in a facility within Australia. The framework restricts access to de-identified data, noting that it cannot be used solely for commercial and non-health-related purposes. Kelsey on Thursday confirmed this means the likes of insurance companies cannot use it to set premiums, as one example. According to Kelsey, when a My Health Record has been cancelled, the contents of the record is dumped as per government data removal procedure, and becomes unavailable for secondary use. With all Australians slated to have a My Health Record by 2018, the 2019 goal is for every registered clinician being provided with a secure means of communicating digitally with their colleagues without \"resorting to paper or the dreaded fax machine\". By 2022, Kelsey said the first selected regions in Australia will have connected all their care services so that clinicians have cross-organisation access to information. \"Digital technology will be the most important enabler of high-quality sustainable health and care in Australia,\" Kelsey said.  \"We are at the start of a journey; the history of technology in healthcare has been very mixed, we must manage our expectations -- technology has transformed other industries ... and it will change the experience of healthcare, but this will take time and patience, this is an evolution much more than a revolution.\" The My Health Record framework for action will be published in July, which will describe a roadmap for the delivery of the three key principals of the Digital Health Agency and the online record. Touching on the three principals, Kelsey said they will be centred on participation, empowering people to take more control of their health and care; collaboration, which will require the co-design of services; and innovation. \"MHR is a part of the solution; it will not solve all the information challenges of modern Australian healthcare, but it is an important step forward ... one of the key digital health basics,\" he said. \"If the world is full of faxes, it will not be full of precision medicines -- let's get the digital basics right.\" Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

The reasons are pretty straightforward: cyber-criminals follow the money, and with over two billion active monthly users, there’s more opportunity to generate revenue by spoofing one the world’s most popular social networks.  Overall, the main targets for phishers remain internet portals, banks, online stores and payment services, with financial phishing the most popular (44%) type, accordingCrypto-currency ICOs also represent a potentially lucrative event for cyber-criminals to leverage.  Around £26,000 was stolen through a phishing site claiming to offer investment opportunities for a rumored Telegram ICO, while £62,000 was stolen from victims via a single phishing email linked to the launch of “The Bee Token” ICO, Kaspersky Lab claimed.  The vendor also warned users of an increase in fake GDPR privacy notices, which require users to fill in their details in order to ‘access’ their accounts.  “We urge users to pay close attention to the new regulation and carefully study any notifications related to it,” it added. “Links should be checked before clicking: they should not contain redirects to third-party sites or domains unrelated to the service on whose behalf the message was sent.”  Germany was the number one target of malicious emails (15%) followed by Russia (6%) and the UK (5%).

Here's what it means, how it'll impact individuals and businesses.                                            \tGDPR is a  \tWhile this seems straightforward enough, compliance with GDPR can mean  \tFew EU residents are aware that the regulations are coming in, and fewer understand what they are about. GDPR has brought headaches and significant costs for many companies, which have had to update their systems with very little benefit to show for it. Critics say the regulations will stifle innovation and risk blaming the victims of cyber crime -- companies that are hacked -- for the behaviour of the criminals that target them. They argue that the vast EU bureaucracy is simply adding another burden that businesses don't need, and that GDPR is simply a licence for consultants and tech companies to print money.  Some of this may be true, but the benefits of GDPR already outweigh the potential downsides.  \tThe most visible effect of GDPR so far, for most people, may be the blizzard of emails from companies seeking permission to continue sending marketing messages. Many people I speak to are cheerfully ignoring the entreaties to opt in, and are using GDPR as an opportunity to break up with companies they can't remember agreeing to receive email from in the first place (I received yet another passive-aggressive GDPR compliance note while writing this).  \tBut there's plenty more going on. Many companies have invested in new security systems to make sure that data is properly protected and only accessed by the appropriate staff. Others have checked the data they hold for accuracy and whether it's still legitimate for them to retain it. GDPR has provided many organisations with an opportunity to revisit their systems, and perhaps even create new  \tGDPR has also forced the big tech companies to make changes to their policies.  \tApple, for example, has rolled out  \tGDPR's impact isn't only being felt in Europe: some companies feel obliged to offer the same level of privacy protection to customers beyond the EU.

GDPR comes into force at the right time, with privacy and data protection currently high on the political agenda thanks to a number of recent data governance scandals. Countless leaks and hacks have exposed vast amounts of personally identifiable information with very little impact on the companies or organisations that allowed it to happen. Regulators have not had the powers to make companies up their data-protection game. Companies that suffer data breaches may see a short-term dip in their stock value, but they tend to bounce back quickly, so the markets aren't creating a deterrent either. Until now, there has been little incentive for companies to protect customers' personal information.  \tIt's still early days for GDPR, and it will develop further once in force. Whether those big fines actually materialise will depend on how seriously companies have taken their preparations and ongoing compliance. Fear of these fines motivates much of the work being done, of course, but GDPR already shows that regulation can help to tame the behaviour of the tech giants. From security and mobiles to Windows and shadow IT. The non-profit alliance has added GDPR compliance to its yearly vendor auditing system and announced it will be taking on new members for the first time. Failure to comply with the data protection regulations could result in a €20 million fine, and Australian organisations with links to Europe will not be exempt. The deadline for complying with the   GDPR, a   The Crowd Research report, based on the results of an online survey of more than 531 IT, cyber security, and   Just 40 percent of those surveyed said they're either GDPR-compliant or well on their way to compliance in time for the deadline, and only 7 percent said they're in full compliance with GDPR requirements.          Many of the organizations (80 percent) concede that GDPR compliance is a top priority, yet only half said they are knowledgeable about the data privacy legislation or have deep expertise with regard to the regulation. What's even more alarming is that given the amount of publicity surrounding GDPR, one quarter of the organizations said they have no knowledge or only limited knowledge of the law.   \"What is striking in this study is the lack of staff with GDPR expertise and an overall underestimation of the effort required to meet GDPR, which represents the most sweeping change in data privacy regulation in decades,\" said Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders and founder of the Information Security Community on LinkedIn, which commissioned the study.         The main compliance challenges facing organizations are a lack of expert staff (cited by 43 percent), lack of budget (40 percent), and a limited understanding of GDPR regulations (31 percent). Most of the organizations (56 percent) expect their   About one third of the organizations said they'll need to make big changes to their data security practices and systems to comply with GDPR, and more than half expect to make only minor changes.   At most organizations, IT and information security teams have the main responsibility for meeting GDPR compliance. A majority of them said making an inventory of user data, and mapping the data to protected GDPR categories, is a priority in their GDPR compliance efforts. This is followed by evaluating, developing, and integrating systems that support GDPR compliance.   Most of the organizations' insider threat programs are not meeting GDPR reporting guidelines, the report said. GDPR's \"Right to Explanation\" gives EU citizens the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing. About one third of the organizations said their current automated assessment techniques are \"black boxed.\" That means they're not able to explain how the algorithms made a decision.   Most GDPR-relevant data is stored on premises. But about one third of the organizations store data in the cloud or in hybrid IT environments, which makes control over the data potentially more difficult, the report said.

The company announced Wednesday that it will close down the self-driving vehicle program in Arizona, a move that will affect more than 300 jobs, according to the A spokeswoman for Uber said that the company will not be eliminating all of their autonomous vehicle programs but will resume operations this summer with a limited focus, testing fewer cars with smaller routes in Pittsburgh and two cities in California. Uber will first have to nail down a testing permit in California, Before returning cars to the road, though, Uber was awaiting for the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB's) preliminary report from its investigation of the crash. Released While NTBS continues to collect information, Uber hopes to soar to new heights with its announcement that it will invest $23.4 million into developing an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft in France over the next five years, according to \"France is a perfect home for our next step forward with its strong history of research and development, world class engineers and a unique role in aviation worldwide,\" Uber said in a statement to As Uber calculates its best strategy to move forward, Apple races full speed ahead, away from BMW and straight toward Volkswagen. After waiting for BMW to take its foot off the brakes for several years now, Apple has decided to partner with a new company to get the wheels turning on its self-driving car design.  \"Apple has signed a deal with Volkswagen to turn some of the carmaker's new T6 Transporter vans into Apple's self-driving shuttles for employees – a project that is behind schedule and consuming nearly all of the Apple car team's attention, said three people familiar with the project,\"         \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                  \tA few days ago, my phone rang with yet another call from \"my local Google specialist.\" I get these every day or so, and sometimes more than once on a given day. Even though I always block the number, the calls keep coming.  \tIn a fit of petulant peevishness, I posted a missive on Twitter complaining about the calls: Don't call me, big bro! Much to my surprise, I got a ton of replies from followers and even other columnists, all sharing their same level of frustration. Clearly, this was a thing. I decided to follow the approach one of my old bosses used to insist on: \"Don't just whine about the problem, find a solution.\" Clearly, he had never met any bloggers. Even so, that aphorism has always appealed to me, so I reached out to Google.  As it turns out, In May 2018, The company says, \"We hope this sends the message to other scammers out there that we will not hesitate to take legal action against them.\"       Google has also announced that they've developed \"new automated and manual techniques to better identify Google accounts tied to scam efforts.\" This allows the company to take action in terms of either removing accounts or limiting their functionality. If you represent a community or an organization, Google may be able to send out a speaker to help your community avoid fraud and scams. There's  To be clear, Google will not robocall you, unless you've requested an automated callback. Here's Google's  So, if you get an unsolicited call and a human is not on the other end, no matter what the recording says, it's not from Google. Hang up. Even if the recording says to hit a button to talk to a human, hang up. If there's a human eventually connected, it will not be a Google human. You'll be, at best, talking to a business that doesn't represent Google, and, at worst, chatting with a criminal trying to scam you.  According to  The problem is, it's going to be difficult to tell if these callers are legitimately from Google or from another party. Clearly, if the call begins with a recording, you can be almost positive it's a fake. But if there's a human at the other end from the beginning of the conversation, there's no easy way to confirm legitimacy.  My advice in this case is simple: don't give out any personal information to someone who dials your digits out of the blue. It is best that you simply not engage, and hang up.  There is no single way to make these calls stop. I've been blocking calls as they come in, but it's kind of a whack-a-mole situation. As soon as you block one number, another is used to call at a different time. Google now says that if you \"claim your business\" on Google, there's a substantially-reduced likelihood that you'll be approached by scammers. To do so,  Since numbers reported on Caller ID are no longer tied to specific land line locations and can be easily spoofed, blocking calls will only get you so far. Even so, I have found that the frequency of disturbances has dropped measurably since I started blocking religiously.  Another option is to add your number to the National Do Not Call Registry at  The problem is, many of these calls originate from call centers outside the US or are not subject to US law. Other phone spammers are Americans, but they move their operations around enough that they're too difficult to track and block.  That said, if you do get enough information about a caller to file a complaint, the FCC has a mechanism for you to do so. Visit the  While we're on the subject of not fixing anything, Google, too, has a complaint form you can fill out. This form helps Google gather information about calls, but the company is upfront about setting expectations. They say, \"Please note that this form will not directly impact whether you will receive robocalls in the future.\"  That said, if you want to do something,  Here's the bottom line to all of this: scammers will scam. No matter what you try, you're still going to get the occasional annoying call. The only consolation I can offer is that we're all in this together. Don't let it raise your blood pressure or get you so angry that you scare your dog. Just hang up and move on with your day.  And, hey, if you want something to really look forward to, there's this: the 2018 election season is around the corner. It's not illegal for politicians in America to use automated dialing devices to pitch their platforms. See? I'll bet that cheered you right up. \"It's your data. Keep it,\" says T-Mobile's store in Times Square, New York City. Except when the company is leaking it. (Image: file photo) A bug in T-Mobile's website let anyone access the personal account details of any customer with just their cell phone number. The flaw, since fixed, could have been exploited by anyone who knew where to look -- a little-known T-Mobile subdomain that staff use as a customer care portal to access the company's internal tools. The subdomain -- Although the API is understood to be used by T-Mobile staff to look up account details, it wasn't protected with a password and could be easily used by anyone. The returned data included a customer's full name, postal address, billing account number, and in some cases information about tax identification numbers. The data also included customers' account information, such as if a bill is past-due or if the customer had their service suspended. The data also included references to account PINs used by customers as a security question when contacting phone support. Anyone could use that information to hijack accounts.        T-Mobile pulled the API offline a day after it was reported in early April by security researcher Ryan Stevenson, who was later awarded $1,000 in a bug bounty. Stevenson sent A T-Mobile spokesperson said: \"The bug bounty program exists so that researchers can alert us to vulnerabilities, which is what happened here, and we support this type of responsible and coordinated disclosure.\" \"The bug was patched as soon as possible and we have no evidence that any customer information was accessed,\" the spokesperson added. T-Mobile had 74 million customers, as of The bug is nearly identical to an exposed API issue found last year that was located on a different T-Mobile subdomain, as Although T-Mobile said at the time it found \"no evidence\" that customer data was stolen, it later transpired that hackers already found the exposed API and had been exploiting the bug for weeks.

Google attracts a lot of sharp engineers, so I was exposed to a lot of good interaction and visibility. It was a fantastic experience. At some point however, for anyone in security, you want to take the next step and manage security from A to Z at one company. That wasn’t something I could do at Google and I felt ready to make that move.  The scale of the challenge makes it more interesting. It takes a special mindset to do security for a security company.  In addition to successful authentication attempts, we also see attack attempts against our customers and our platforms. We don’t stop at analyzing traffic – we have to be able to harden the platform in a way that protects both Okta and Okta customers. Businesses are trusting us with their applications and their data and that is a great responsibility. We have to be ahead of the attacker to block those attacks.  You need the evil bit – to be able to think like an attacker. This should be the whole security team and indeed the whole company. We have to instill the culture that we (and our customers) are targets. You have to stay on the cutting edge of those attacks and harden the platform.  You have to also understand the business and your customers’ expectations. You need to understand the investment that customers are making in you as a vendor and become the customer advocate. We have to protect Okta, but also our customers.  Historically people thought that increasing security meant changing or hindering the customer experience.  We are gradually changing that by providing a much better user experience. We are talking about lessening password authentication, using multiple technical components to consume the contextual signals to maintain a higher level of assurance that you are who you say you are. Moving forward, we can rely more on context and behavior. We want to establish normal and react to abnormal.  There is a concerted effort to raise the bar. There’s absolutely no question about the importance of information security. But how it is done depends on the company, the industry, the compliance requirements. The will to raise the bar and make the change is always there, but the speed it takes to make changes is different – we’re getting faster, but sometimes it’s not fast enough.  Attackers can move faster – they don’t have to comply and are agile and persistent. As an industry, we need to continue trying to make these changes faster and streamline the processes standing in the way of raising the bar – compliance, governance and finding talent.  We have to stay steps ahead of the attacker and that cutting-edge talent is very hard to find. Once you hire, you then have to be able to retain. To retain these highly-qualified engineers you have to give them highly complex cutting-edge problems. That’s the number one motivation for these types of individuals. They have to buy into your vision as a company and see a culture aligned with their beliefs and vision.  For now, automation is at the top of my agenda. Trying to automate as much as possible. I want to help customers get better at doing security. That’s what I want to keep doing - understanding how they use Okta products and how to make them more secure. I also want to continue to improve usability without impacting security.        \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 \t Bitcoin Gold (BTG) appears to be the target of a 51 percent attack, leading to the theft of approximately $17.5 million from cryptocurrency exchanges. Traders of the coin, Scrutiny of unusual activity on the network has revealed the scheme, in which \"double spending\" attacks have been launched against cryptocurrency exchanges trading the virtual currency. According The first attack was recorded on 16 May and have now appeared to have ceased.        \"An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use \"51 percent attacks\" to perform \"double spend\" attacks to steal money from exchanges,\" the team says. \"We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits. There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held.\" 51 percent attacks force reorganization in the blockchain. While not the result of a security flaw or vulnerabilities, the attack can -- theoretically -- be launched against any blockchain.       If a threat actor manages to wrestle control of over 50 percent of a network's computing power, they are able to both modify and exclude transactions of their own coins from blocks. Attackers are then able to double spend, in which transactions are reversed after being confirmed, as well as prevent all other miners on a network from mining valid blocks. Launching these types of attacks can be expensive and due to the vast computing power required, the only way they are made profitable is to attempt large double spend transactions -- and this, in turn, pivots attacks towards cryptocurrency exchanges. The The majority of the funds have been moved to other addresses and only roughly 12,000 BTG remains in the account. \"One of the targeted exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past,\" the Bitcoin Gold team says. \"In their words, \"we are 100 percent sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.\" The Bitcoin Gold team says that a major upgrade planned for the end of June -- now being pushed to take place as soon as possible -- will eradicate the use of ASIC hardware to mine BTG. ASIC systems are expected to ship at approximately the same time and have the potential to cause an imbalance to existing miners, and therefore, the team is tampering with the BTG algorithm to prevent this from occurring. The organization says that the change in algorithm and a new fork will also reduce the risk of 51 percent attacks in the future. \"We've been working at an incredible pace the past days to put the plan and pieces together, and we expect to upgrade our mainnet approximately seven days after the necessary software is up and running on our testnet,\" the team says. \"[...] While it would be better to give all our partners more than seven days to test and deploy to avoid disruption, these attacks have already forced disruption on us all, so we feel it's best to get the upgrade completed as soon as we possibly can.\" According to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, recent estimates suggest that since 2017, cyberattackers have managed to steal $1.2 billion in cryptocurrencies from exchanges, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), wallets, and more. A similar attack method has recently been employed against Verge, a cryptocurrency offering which claims to bring back the anonymity once associated with cryptocurrency as a whole.

The GDPR has been several years in the making, and introduces strict new obligations for organizations on how they process and protect customer and employee data as well as how they seek consent for using that data.  The rights group claimed that the business model of many data companies raises significant question marks over compliance with the new law, which is EU-wide but also applies to any organization which processes data on EU citizens.  Non-consumer facing data companies such as Acxiom, Criteo and Quantcast “amass and exploit” large quantities of consumer data without directly interacting with the data subject, according to Privacy International.  If they collect this data without the user’s knowledge, use it to profile users, or share it with another company for a different purpose to that stated at the time of collection, they could be in breach of the GDPR, the group claimed.  To launch the campaign, Privacy International has sent letters to a selection of the companies involved to find out more on how they handle personal data.  The non-profit claimed that companies and governments are increasingly exploiting not just data that consumers willingly provide but information they can “observe, derive, and infer” in order to manipulate people’s lives without accountability.  Privacy International legal officer, Ailidh Callander, welcomed the GDPR.  “It's been a long time coming, and the GDPR is an important step in the right direction, providing essential safeguards to our human rights to privacy and data protection, by imposing more stringent obligations on companies, strengthening rights of individuals, and increasing enforcement powers,” she added.  “GDPR is a key tool to empower individuals, civil society, and journalists to fight against data exploitation.\"  The group has also joined the Center for Digital Democracy and Public Citizen in writing to almost 100 US companies asking that they implement GDPR for users globally, as Microsoft and other tech giants have promised.    \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Microsoft's Windows Defender ranks seventh out of 15 antivirus (AV) products in an independent test. But the results don't tell the whole picture, argues Microsoft.  With improvements to Windows 10's built-in Windows Defender antivirus, some users are But according to the The top AV products for Windows 10 across protection, performance, and usability Windows Defender rated highly on protection, detecting 100 percent of new and old malware, but lost points for performance, which measures how much an AV slows applications and websites; and usability, which counts false-positives or instances where AV wrongly identifies a file as malicious.  Windows Defender's performance rating was dragged down because it slowed the installation of frequently used applications more than the industry average, and wrongly detected 16 pieces of legitimate software compared with the industry average of four.        But Microsoft wants enterprise customers to know that Windows Defender is only half the picture, given the option for customers to also deploy Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection's (ATP) \"stack components\" including Smartscreen, Application Guard, and Application Control.     In the January and February test Windows Defender also scored 100 percent on protection. However it did miss two samples. Since then it's retrained its machine-learning classifiers to detect them.  But Microsoft notes in a \"As threats become more sophisticated, Microsoft and other security platform vendors continue evolving their product capabilities to detect threats across different attack stages,\" Microsoft's Windows Defender Research team writes.  \"We hope to see independent testers evolve their methodologies as well. Our customers need greater transparency and optics into what an end-to-end solution can accomplish in terms of total preventive protection, including the quality of individual components like antivirus.  \"Microsoft is highly engaged in working with several independent testers to evolve security testing to focus on end-to-end security stack testing.\"  Windows Defender still has problems with incorrectly classifying legitimate apps as malware, according to the January-February test.  However, Microsoft contends that all 21 of the misclassified apps were either media players or audio mixers, which aren't common in enterprise environments.  It also argues that the false-positives in the synthetic test don't factor in contextual information Microsoft uses in the real-world machines that prevent Defender from wrongly flagging clean apps as bad.   And Windows Defender still significantly slower than the industry average for installing frequently used applications. However, again Microsoft counters that enterprise users generally spend less time installing new apps and more time using browsers, email, and word processors.   Windows 10 security won't protect you from tech-support scammers' lies and trickery. Just scanning a specially-crafted file could lead to a totally compromised Windows machine. Microsoft is continuing to polish its coming Windows 10 release with Fast Ring Insider Build 17120 as it heads toward the finish line. Microsoft is adding Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1 to the list of protected end-points covered by Windows Defender ATP, starting this summer. Microsoft preps new Windows 10 security features to ensure system integrity during start-up and after it's running.

The vendor polled over 100 healthcare IT professionals at the recent 2018 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Conference in the US.  Unsurprisingly given the sizeable number that had suffered an attack, 77% of respondents said they were very concerned about a cybersecurity event hitting the organization while 15% admitted they needed to do more to improve their cyber-defenses.  Ransomware (32%) was the biggest concern in terms of online threats. That’s understandable, given the WannaCry attack of May 2017 devastated large parts of the NHS, leading to an estimated 19,000 cancelled operations and appointments.  Worryingly, over a quarter (26%) of respondents claimed they don’t have an incident response plan in place — something required by the new GDPR.  In addition, 28% said their healthcare organization (HCO) doesn’t even have chief information security officer (CISO).  A recent report from Answering questions on the insider threat, respondents to the Imperva poll said they were most concerned about careless users (51%). While 27% claimed a lack of tools to monitor employees and other activities makes detecting insider threats difficult.  “Attackers understand the value of the data held by healthcare organizations, and as a result, they are quickly becoming a sweet spot for hackers looking to steal large amounts of patient records for profit,” argued “There have been a number of incidents recently where cybercrime has impacted hospitals and left them unable to access patient data, which demonstrates the consequences of a successful attack. It is crucial that healthcare organizations take steps to protect their data. To retain patient trust, organizations must provide an excellent defense at all times.” \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 There's a 30GB database ofOkta's As not all web sites are going to use either of those, PassProtect is also available as Of course, passing your password around the internet to check whether it's safe needs to be done securely. PassProtect uses Cloudflare's The extension computes the SHA1 hash of the password, takes In the long term, moving away from passwords to contextual security and biometrics will protect us better. That means that when you're trying to access a really important document you'll need to use multiple factors like clicking 'ok' on a push message on your phone or a face or fingerprint scan on a device you've already used, that's up to date on patches and anti-malware protection on a known network.  But when you're logging into the same site you log into at the same time every day, from the same physical location using the same network connection and the same IP address, and what you're looking at isn't unusually confidential, you won't have to type in a password at all.  Identity services like Azure AD and now Okta support that kind of contextual security, because making security more usable makes it more secure; annoyingly difficult security is what people try to get around. IT policies shouldn't force users to change their password every 90 days if it hasn't been phished or stolen from the password database. As Okta vice president Rich Dandliker put it at the company's recent Oktane conference, the number of forced password changes directly correlates with the number of passwords that get written down on Post-it notes. Biometrics and hardware options have their own issues; you can lose a hardware key and almost every biometric system from fingerprints to iris recognition to hand vein prints to voice biometrics fails for around 20 percent of the population (not to mention storing a hash that matches the biometric features rather than an image of your fingerprint, since you can't reset your fingers if that database gets breached).  But as these options becomes a standard (through FIDO and the W3C), it's another step away from the ongoing dumpster fire that is internet passwords. A combination like Windows Hello which falls back to a PIN if the recognition fails is a good compromise - even if that's a short PIN, because it's stored only on the PC where you register the biometric, and it's stored in silicon. To break that, you'd have to steal the PC and type in guess after guess until you got it right. As Okta's Alex Bovee said at Oktane, \"If as an industry we've reduced the attack surface on our users to having to physically steal a device, that's a pretty good achievement.\" Once browsers and web sites support the FIDO and WebAuthN standards, they can exchange tokens based on biometrics and hardware to log you in and you won't have to worry nearly as much about whether a site has leaked your password. Until then, an extension like PassProtect is well worth installing.  Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

However, the malware team at the Media Trust has discovered that the very attributes that allow HTML5 to deliver the content of popular formats without external plugins are also being used to cloak malware. By breaking it into smaller parts, the malware is harder to detect, but when certain conditions are met, those broken parts are pieced back together.   While researchers have discovered HTML5 malware before, these instances are different because they require no victim interaction and are targeting devices that have trouble detecting malware.   “The HTML5 malware was designed to entice victims to enter their information in response to a pop-up ad. This campaign is quickly spreading through the online world, waiting for individuals with the right devices to trigger the collection of personally identifiable information,” The Media Trust wrote.

Following the latest investigative findings that the Russian military was responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014, the Russian military has issued its latest denial that it was involved in the tragedy. In a statement on Friday, the Defense Ministry said the missile engine’s unit number, which indicates that it was manufactured outside Moscow in 1986, proves that the weapon fired at flight MH17 wasn’t in the Russian military’s arsenal, because Russia’s armed forces decommissioned and scrapped all 1986-generation missiles in 2011. The ministry pointed out that Ukraine didn’t receive a single new missile for its Buk missile system after 1991, suggesting that it would likely have needed to rely on older Soviet munitions. Later on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov endorsed the Defense Ministry’s position. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov compared the MH17 case to British allegations that Moscow is responsible for poisoning former spy Sergey Skripal — another charge widely believed in the West that the Kremlin denies. On Friday, May 25, In a press conference on Thursday, the Joint Investigative Team stated what has become obvious for many observers around the world: the Buk missile that shot down flight MH17, killing all 298 people on board, was fired from a Russian military unit. The announcement on May 24 pinned the deadly incident on Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. Open-source researchers at The Netherlands and Australia announced on Friday that they now formally hold Russia responsible for the downing of flight MH17. “We call on Russia to accept its responsibility and cooperate fully with the process to establish the truth and achieve justice for the victims of flight MH17 and their next of kin,” The United States government has also endorsed the Joint Investigative Team’s findings, saying in a                     The European Union's attempt to increase consumer control of personal data has already had some useful effects. This puts it well ahead of earlier EU interventions, such as the annoying notifications of website cookies and the utterly pointless You may well have ignored or just deleted the deluge of emails about the GDPR, and I can't blame you. I actually read most of them, to get an idea of the range of approaches and which ones worked best. I also searched my mailbox for the suppliers' domain names to see if I'd received any marketing emails, how often they came, and whether I'd read any of them. In several cases there were more than a hundred unread emails, so I was able to select and delete them all at once. I don't read most emails because if I did, I'd never get any work done. I just delete the obviously useless 40 percent unread, and reply to the half-dozen or so that matter. That usually leaves a dozen or more unreads that are not obviously useless but don't obviously need my attention. \"News announcements\" (ie PR) quite often fall into that category. If my search turned up a bunch of useless emails, I unsubscribed. As a result, my mailbox is slimmer and should be cleaner in the future.        While many companies will no doubt be alarmed that their mailing lists have shrunk dramatically - actual numbers welcome - they should be grateful. The people who have opted in must feel their messages have some value, so they're better prospects. Mailing lists will further improve in quality now people have to opt in actively, not passively, and sign-ups should always be confirmed.       I've received dozens of emails intended for other people, usually because customers have given companies my email address by mistake, and companies haven't checked or confirmed it. I've received airline tickets, confirmations of my new car insurance policy and my Apple Genius Bar appointment, thanks from the G4S recruitment team, and payment receipts from an exercise class in Prattville, Alabama, amng others.  Nope, nope. nope.... Other erroneous emails have arrived from Barclaycard Business, Paddy Power, Pokerstars, Vodafone and others who must already have improved their systems. They're all companies that have to take the GDPR seriously, and I'm sure they do. The UK's ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) has warned that \"Happily, nearly 60 percent of the companies in an IBM survey claim they are \"embracing GDPR as an opportunity to improve privacy, security, data management or as catalyst for new business models, rather than simply a compliance issue or impediment\". IBM's Institute for Business Value (IBV) and Oxford Economics Go thou and do likewise. Companies also see GDPR as an opportunity to build trust and drive innovation. Specifically: A few leading companies - less than 20 percent - said they were \"fully implementing security and privacy by design for new products and services\". That's a scarily low number because \"privacy by design\" is actually one of the GDPR's demands. The full IBM report, It may turn out that the real key to GDPR is not so much getting consent for mailing lists as devising systems that (1) help prevent mistakes, and (2) that enable companies to collect and report data breaches within 72 hours, as the law requires. In my experience, some large companies make it almost impossible to report mistakes without hounding them on Twitter. For example, they have webforms that demand your account number when you don't have an account, and they just send you utterly pointless boilerplate back. I have never seen an option that says: \"I am not a customer. You've emailed me somenone else's data by mistake.\" In one rather old case, it took roughly a year to stop a company sending me someone else's monthly bills - someone I could identify and locate - and I had to escalate it to the Director's Office to get a result.  Next time, I'll take the opportunity to test the system for reporting security breaches. It could be a juicy story as well.               \tTwo of Canada's largest banks have issued statements confirming they were contacted by \"fraudsters\" claiming to have personal and financial information on customers in their possession.  \tBank of Montreal (BOM)  \t \t\"Fraudsters contacted BMO claiming that they were in possession of certain personal and financial information for a limited number of customers,\" the statement reads. \"We took steps immediately when the incident occurred and we are confident that exposures identified related to customer data have been closed off.\"  \tBOM said it has notified and is working with relevant authorities as it continues to assess the situation; reports indicate it has  \t\"We are proactively contacting those customers that may have been impacted and we will support and stand by them,\" the bank wrote.         \t\"BMO has strong and robust processes in place to protect customer data and we take customer privacy very seriously.

Grant West, 26, was behind a string of phishing attacks against customers of big-name brands including Just Eat, Sainsbury’s, Ladbrokes and Argos.  Between July and December 2015 he’s said to have conspired with unknown parties to obtain data on Just Eat customers and use it “to facilitate fraudulent transactions whether directly or indirectly following transmission of the data to others.”  He’s also sentenced with conspiracy to defraud by “obtaining, using and supplying …  fullz” – i.e. lucrative packages of complete identity information.  Presumably in order to obtain these credentials, West was convicted of carrying out “brute force” attacks using popular off-the-shelf tool Sentry MBA to compromise the websites of Sainsbury’s, Nectar, Groupon, AO.com, Ladbrokes, Coral betting, Uber, Asda and many more.  He was also convicted of possessing and supplying cannabis and selling “how to” guides to other hackers and fraudsters.  West was caught in dramatic fashion after police finally tracked the IP address of his girlfriend’s laptop, and captured the unlocked device as he was travelling from Rhyl to London by train.  “This prosecution was able to prove that Grant West was the prolific cyber hacker known as Courvoisier. West was caught by police conducting attacks on company websites,” said Sarah Jennings, of the“He sold the lists of financial information to make money and even used stolen credit card details to pay for holidays, food and shopping.

The vulnerabilities identified by eFail are not flaws with the OpenPGP protocol itself but rather flaws in certain implementations of PGP, including in Apple Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Microsoft Outlook. Many other commonly used software based upon PGP are not affected by the eFail vulnerability in any way, as the researchers themselves point out in their paper.”  The authors of the post – including Phil Zimmerman and the developers of Enigmail, Mailvelope and ProtonMail – recommended users switch to PGP implementations that are not impacted by eFail, or update their PGP software to the latest version.  “Ensure that everyone you communicate with is also using unaffected implementations or has updated their PGP software,” they added. “Be sure to get a verified confirmation from your contacts before sending sensitive information to them.”  The quartet are particularly scathing of the EFF, claiming its advice for users to disable PGP plugins or stop using PGP altogether “is akin to saying, ‘some locks can be broken; therefore we must remove all doors’,” and therefore could put individuals at risk if they rely on PGP for security.

The findings are revealed in the tech giant’s latest The requests cover just over 309,000 devices, more than double the 151,000 it received over the same time period in 2016, and back then the number of requests was slightly higher (30,184).  Apple claimed that in the US, the high number of devices specified in requests was “predominantly due to device repair fraud investigations, fraudulent purchase investigations, and stolen device investigations.”  In China, it was due to “tax/device export investigations, device repair/warranty fraud investigations, and stolen device investigations.”  Apple added that device-based requests usually seek “details of customers associated with devices or device connections to Apple services.”  The firm famously prides itself on providing access only up to a point where it is technically possible, and will not – for example – accede to requests by law enforcers to unlock encrypted devices by re-engineering products.

After privacy activist Max Schrems and his None Of Your Business organization This time it's French digital rights group La Quadrature du Net that's on the rampage, and it hasn't just gone after Google and Facebook. It's pursuing Apple, Amazon, and LinkedIn as well.  On Monday, it filed seven complaints with French privacy regulator CNIL against the five companies. Google got separate complaints over Gmail, YouTube, and Search.  La Quad's offensive has been a long time coming. Six weeks ago, it started inviting people to join its collective complaints, and over that time it got more than 12,000 people to sign up. According to operations coordinator Myriam Michel, each complaint has around 9,000 to 10,000 names attached to it.        One of the GDPR's many novelties is that it allows non-profit organizations to complain about companies' violations on behalf of those who might be affected. This action adds weight to the complaints, and makes it more likely that they are well formulated. La Quad's complaints are similar to those from Schrems' NOYB group, in that they focus on the issue of \"forced consent\".       The GDPR requires companies to only process personal data on a specific legal basis, and many companies have chosen consent as their option.  However, in some cases they don't let people use their services at all unless they consent to having their data exploited in ways that are not strictly necessary for delivering the core service. This all-or-nothing approach undermines the concept of consent, according to the new law. And La Quad is not just stopping at these seven complaints. It has been gathering support for a total of 12, with those not lodged on Monday including complaints about Android, WhatsApp, Instagram, Skype and Outlook. \"We met [CNIL] last week and they told us if we target all 12 services it will be complicated and take a long time for the CNIL to work on the files,\" Michel told ZDNet.  \"So we decided to target only seven services, to have answers more quickly from the CNIL. We will target the other services, but later.\" CNIL will most likely coordinate with its counterparts in the various countries where these companies have their European headquarters. That's Luxembourg for Amazon and Ireland for Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn these days.  If the complaints are successful, the companies would have to pay fines of up to €20m ($ m) or four percent of global annual revenue, whichever is higher. In a Monday Google and Facebook have already responded to the NOYB complaints by insisting that they have made a lot of effort to comply with the GDPR.  A LinkedIn spokesperson told ZDNet that it always aims to give its members control over the data it collects and how it is used and shared.  \"We have approached GDPR as an opportunity to reinforce our commitment to data privacy for all members globally,\" the spokesperson said. Amazon and Apple had not responded to requests for comment about the French actions at the time of writing. Facebook nemesis Max Schrems is behind the first challenges to US giants under new European data privacy law. General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is coming.

Kazakhstan-born Karim Baratov, 23, pleaded guilty in November 2017 to spear-phishing at least 80 webmail accounts belonging to “individuals of interest” for the Russian intelligence service the FSB. He’s then said to have sent the account passwords to a co-conspirator in exchange for money.  Baratov is also said to have hacked more than 11,000 webmail accounts in total from around 2010 until his March 2017 arrest in Canada.  Although he wasn’t directly responsible for the Yahoo breach, his co-conspirators in the FSB and fellow “hacker-for-hire” Alexsey Belan were, according to the Department of Justice. Baratov’s job was in fact to hack user accounts for non-Yahoo providers such as Gmail.  The persons of interest Baratov helped the FSB to monitor included Russian journalists, US and Russian government officials and private-sector employees of financial, transportation and other companies, the DoJ said in “It's difficult to overstate the unprecedented nature of this conspiracy, in which members of a foreign intelligence service directed and empowered criminal hackers to conduct a massive cyber-attack against 500 million victim user accounts,” “Today's sentencing demonstrates the FBI's unwavering commitment to disrupt and prosecute malicious cyber actors despite their attempts to conceal their identities and hide from justice.”  The judge also ordered Baratov to pay a fine of $250,000, apparently claiming the large sum would make up for the relatively lenient sentence, which prosecutors wanted doubled.

Europol announced yesterday that it will work with EU partners and global law enforcement agencies to reduce the size of the underground crime economy.  In a 29 May event that marked the official launch of the new Europol Dark Web Team, stakeholders from the European Commission, Interpol, and Eurojust joined with law enforcement agents from 28 countries in The Hague, the Netherlands, and expressed their enthusiasm over the expanded efforts to take down cybercriminals on the dark web.  Through its European Cybercrime Centre (C3), Europol has been actively monitoring the dark web for several years. Investigations in the underground marketplaces have yielded an array of tools, tactics and techniques used by cybercriminals.   As a result, Europol, in partnership with other law enforcement agencies, has successfully shut down The reported success of the crime-fighting partnerships has led to a reduced number of illicit transactions, with Europol reporting that some dark web traders have closed down their platforms for fear of getting caught.   The dedicated Dark Web Team will share information through a coordinated approach, allowing the different agencies to provide operational support and varying degrees of expertise in the wide range of cybercrimes that they are fighting.    Chief commissioner Ivaylo Spiridonov, director of the Bulgarian general directorate combatting organised crime, delivered the opening remarks on behalf of the current Presidency of the Council of the EU and highlighted that “today’s expert assembly will further enhance the law enforcement’s ability to find sustainable solutions and a common coordinated approach to respond to criminality on the dark web.” \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Wyze Cam first made a splash with its With its second product, the Wyze Cam Pan, the company is sticking to its approach of selling inexpensive products. For $30, users can purchase a Wyze Cam Pan that's capable of 360-degree viewing. Users can remotely control the camera via the Wyze Cam app, panning and tilting the unit in order to adjust items in the field of view. Beyond the new form factor and Pan features, the new Wyze Cam still offers the same features as the slightly cheaper standard The camera measures 5.02 x 2.36 x 2.36-inches (HxWxD) and weighs just over half a pound. The base of the camera accepts most tripod mount screws (1/4-20) and is powered by a microUSB cable. The camera's resolution is 1920x1080, with 8x digital zoom. For local storage, the camera accepts microSD cards up to 32GB and works with iOS 8.0 and Android 5.0 or later. I had the chance to use a Wyze Cam Pan for the past few days and found the ability to move the camera helpful. I still haven't figured out the best location for the Pan model, thanks to its ability to move I feel confident in monitoring more than one room (say a hallway and the living room) with a single camera, instead of multiple cameras.       I didn't have a lot of time to test out the Motion Tracking feature due to some last minute updates, but initial impressions are good. As the Pan recognizes motion within its field of view, the camera will move with that person or object as it moves across the room. In a wide open room free of any other moving objects, the Pan followed me without hesitation. The only critique I would make is that the movement of the camera isn't smooth, but rather one quick motion, and as such, it sometimes overshoots the moving object.

Kaspersky Lab’s founder Eugene Kaspersky had argued that the rulings violate the Fifth Amendment by interfering with due process.  However, judge Kollar-Kotelly dismissed both arguments, ruling that the NDAA “eliminates a perceived risk to the nation’s cybersecurity and, in so doing, has the secondary effect of foreclosing one small source of revenue for a large multinational corporation.”  As the NDAA is taking effect later this year, the BOD wouldn’t cause any further impact to Kaspersky Lab because government agencies would already be warned off buying its products, she added.  In a“Kaspersky Lab maintains that these actions were the product of unconstitutional agency and legislative processes and unfairly targeted the company without any meaningful fact finding,” it added.  “Given the lack of evidence of wrongdoing by the company and the imputation of malicious cyber activity by nation-states to a private company, these decisions have broad implications for the global technology community.

An open letter to national security adviser (NSA), John Bolton, expressed concern that the lack of a special assistant to the President and cybersecurity coordinator would hamper US efforts at precisely the wrong time.  It detailed concerns from US lawmakers and intelligence officials of Russia’s growing confidence in conducting audacious cyber-attacks against its geopolitical enemies.  “Our country’s cybersecurity should be a top priority; therefore, it is critically important that the US government present a unified front in defending against cyber-attacks. Eliminating the cybersecurity coordinator role keeps us from presenting that unified front and does nothing to deter our enemies from attacking us again,” the “Instead, it would represent a step in the wrong direction. Again, we urge you to send a strong signal to the rest of the world that cybersecurity is a top priority by reconsidering the elimination of the cybersecurity coordinator.”  News that the It’s believed controversial NSA Bolton was behind the decision, which came amidst aThe decision was justified on the basis of “streamlining management” reducing bureaucracy and increasing accountability by placing decision-making firmly in the National Security Council.  It’s unlikely that the letter will change policy, given that all 19 senators are Democrats, even though it features the signatures of heavyweights including Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warner, the latter vice-chairman of the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee.    \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 A severe vulnerability has been patched in Git software source code to prevent remote code execution attacks being launched at users. The bug, which is industry-wide, was The software is an example of a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) and is used by companies large and small, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Gnome, and PostgreSQL. The vulnerability, Remote repositories may contain definitions for submodules -- and data -- which are contained and checked in to the parent repository as a folder. When this repository is cloned, Git checks the parent system before preparing to clone related submodules. As the submodule's repository already exists on disk, full cloning is skipped and the software will only check the on-disk version.       When you use Git to clone a repository, some configuration elements are also intentionally left out to prevent remote servers from fetching and executing code on remote systems. Some of the configurations left out including the content of the .git/config file and hook scripts. The vulnerability, however, allows exactly this to happen. Edward Thomson, program manager for Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) at Microsoft \"The submodule repository can therefore actually have a hook already configured,\" Thomson explained. \"If when you recursively cloned (and this repository does have to be cloned with -- recursive for this vulnerability to manifest) this carefully crafted malicious parent repository, it will first check out the parent, then read the submodule's checked-in repository in order to write the submodule to the working directory, and finally it will execute any post-checkout hooks that are configured in the submodule's checked-in repository.\" The solution to a problem which could lead to remote code execution attacks has turned out to be rather simple. Git clients will now investigate submodule folder names more closely and they must be present within the .gitrepository folder, rather than working directories. Another bug, The security flaws have been resolved in the latest update of the software, Git v2.17.1, as well as The update also includes Git server-side support to reject pushes to repositories that attempt to create malformed .gitmodules files. The developers of Git say that this should \"help hosting sites protect their customers with older clients by preventing malicious contents from spreading.\" Credit was given to security researcher Improving device security, better coordination between infrastructure companies, and smarter procurement by businesses are all part of tackling the botnet menace, according to a US government report. The snappily titled Botnets and the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks they deliver Traditional ways of dealing with DDoS effectively involved network providers building in excess capacity to absorb the impact of an attack. However, these incidents have grown in size to more than one terabit per second, far outstripping expected size and excess capacity.  On top of this, standard ways of dealing with DDoS are unable to stop other uses of botnets, such as spreading ransomware. And as botnets add The report from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Commerce highlights a number of changes that need to be made.  Infrastructure providers should share more data about evolving threats -- especially with smaller, less well-funded, or niche players -- and see what benefits come from a move to IPv6, the report said.        Enterprises need to isolate legacy devices and other devices that cannot be secured, deploy on- and off-premise DDoS mitigation services and rethink their network architectures.  Industry and law enforcement should work to find ways to coordinate more often and earlier to detect and prevent threat activity, and to manage incidents that take place. But the biggest section of the report deals with the threat from devices -- PCs, smartphones and IoT devices which, it said, have often been designed without security in mind.  \"Developers are either unaware of good security design practices, assume that the device will be inaccessible (e.g., on a local network inaccessible from the Internet), or want to avoid security solutions that impose additional cost, increase time to market, or make a device harder for consumers to use. The resulting design choices, such as hard-coded administrative passwords, create inherently insecure devices. In other cases, appropriate security controls are present but usability and user interfaces result in less-secure configurations.\" The report noted that software development result in -- optimistically -- a flaw every 2,000 lines of code, and many of these flaws create exploitable security vulnerabilities. Although modern servers, desktops, laptops, and smartphones offer significantly fewer opportunities for compromise, this is not the case with new classes of device. \"IoT devices are often sorely lacking in security-focused features. These systems now offer the most attractive target to malicious actors, and are an increasingly large percentage of the devices in the ecosystem,\" the report warned. Another problem is that modern devices are not the only ones connected to the internet: many legacy servers, desktops, laptops, and mobile phones in use today are no longer supported by their manufacturers, so their vulnerabilities cannot be easily addressed. Software piracy can run as high as 70 percent in China, and manufacturers typically restrict the distribution of security patches to systems running legally purchased software, so these systems cannot be secured against known vulnerabilities.  All of this needs to change, the report said.  \"Devices must be able to resist attacks throughout their deployment lifecycles -- at the time of shipment, during use, and through to end-of-life. For this to occur, security must become a primary design requirement. Vendors must not ship devices with known serious security flaws, must include a secure update mechanism, and must follow best current practices (e.g., no hard-coded passwords, disabling software features that are not critical to operation) for system configuration and administration. Vendors should disclose the minimum duration of support to customers, and device manufacturers should maintain secure update services for the promised duration.\" However, the report acknowledged that at the moment the economics of tech work against security: \"Market incentives appear to exacerbate the problem. Product developers prioritize time to market and innovative functionality over security and resilience. Security features are not easily understood or communicated to the consumer, which makes it difficult to generate demand.\"  The report said that change could start with the enterprise buyer, and -- perhaps optimistically -- argued: \"The value proposition for better security will likely start in the enterprise environment due to its economies of scale; once there is a generally accepted security posture in a given product class, few manufacturers would be likely to ignore it.\"  Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

Because it is designed to be accessed by trusted clients inside trusted environments, Redis should not be publicly exposed.  \"To help protect Redis servers from falling victim to these infections, they should never be connected to the internet and, because Redis does not use encryption and stores data in plain text, no sensitive data should ever be stored on the servers,\" Avital wrote.   \"Security issues commonly arise when people don’t read the documentation and migrate services to the cloud, without being aware of the consequences or the adequate measures that are needed to do so,\" he continued.   The research revealed the magnitude of the problem within 24 hours of being made public. Once publicly available, the servers of Imperva customers were targeted by vulnerability scanners and crypto-mining infections and attacked more than 70,000 times by 295 IPs.  \"The attacks included SQL injection, cross-site scripting, malicious file uploads, remote code executions etc. These numbers suggest that attackers are harnessing vulnerable Redis servers to mount further attacks on the attacker’s behalf,\" Avital said.   \"As a side note, going through the huge amount of publicly available data, we found private SSH keys that can be used to access servers, certificates that can be used to decrypt network traffic, PII, and more sensitive data,\" he said.             \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 The app, used by fitness fanatics and athletes, has over six million users.

The data also included the user's app bio, workout and activity goals, and users' full resolution profile photos, who a user has blocked, and if the user has rated the app.        The app also exposed user-submitted health information -- such as height, weight, and other data points, like caffeine and alcohol consumption, smoking frequency, health concerns, medications, and injuries.

Her decisive action also helped galvanise an international coalition in a very short time frame,\" it says.  \t\"Obviously that was a serious matter that required a speedy response, but the speed was also possible because government leaders are more used to dealing with physical world incidents.

Inaction creates its own norm, or at least an expectation on the part of bad state actors that their activity is acceptable because there are no costs for their actions and no likely costs for future bad acts,\" he writes.  \tPainter's solution is to speed up the attribution of cyber attacks, name and shame as soon as possible, and create a credible response beyond that -- ideally doing all of this as part of a collective multilateral action.        \t\"Although attribution is often achievable, even if difficult, it still seems to take far too long -- at least for public announcements of state attribution,\" he writes.  \tDelays can be due to the technical difficulty of gathering evidence; balancing the benefits of going public against the risk of compromising the \"sources and methods\" of intelligence gathering, and \"the need to summon the political will to announce blame and take action\".  \t\"All of these cycles need to be shortened,\" Pointer writes.  \tPublic attribution, or \"naming and shaming\", can be an effective tool, especially when done collectively.

Some, like kinetic responses, are highly unlikely to be used unless a cyber event causes death and physical injury similar to a physical attack. Others admittedly take a while to develop and deploy, but we have to have the political willingness to use them decisively in the appropriate circumstances and in a timely manner.\"  \tThe US government, for example, has had the power to impose cyber-specific sanctions since April 2015, but has only used them twice: Once in December 2017 against Russian actors for election interference and a second time in March 2018, again against Russian actors.  \t\"For the threat of sanctions to be taken seriously, they must be used in a more regular and timely manner, and their targets should be chosen to have a real effect on the violating state's decision-making.\"  \tPointer's recommendations include shortening the attribution cycle, or if attribution can't be made quickly, couple the eventual public attribution with \"at least one visible responsive action\". He also calls for cybersecurity to be \"mainstreamed\" and treated as a core national and economic security concern, not as \"a boutique technical issue\".  \t\"We must change the calculus of those who believe this is a costless enterprise.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has once again found itself in the spotlight for the potential mishandling of customer information, admitting it had sent over 650 incorrectly addressed internal emails. The bank said on Friday it had completed an investigation that was initiated after a concern was raised about internal CBA emails being inadvertently sent to email addresses using the cba.com domain, prior to taking ownership of that domain in April 2017. Its usual email domain is cba.com.au. According to the bank, the cba.com domain name was first used by US-based financial services firm Cheslock Bakker  Associates up until the 2016-17 period, where it was used by a US cybersecurity firm.  CBA found that 651 internal emails sent during 2016-17, which contained data relating to approximately 10,000 customers, were received by the then user of the cba.com domain.        \"An extensive and detailed investigation by CBA confirmed the contents of all 651 internal emails were automatically deleted by the cba.com domain owner's system, which only collected information on CBA sender and recipient email addresses and the subject of the email,\" the bank wrote in a statement on Friday. The bank claims its investigation found that the emails and any associated data had not been used and were permanently deleted from the domain owner's servers.       \"We want our customers to know that we are committed to being more transparent about data security and privacy matters,\" CBA acting group executive Retail Banking Services Angus Sullivan said. \"Our investigation confirmed that no customer data has been compromised as a result of this issue. We acknowledge however that customers want to be informed about data security and privacy issues and we have begun contacting affected customers.\" The bank said that from January last year it has been blocking internal emails addressed to the cba.com domain name.  Since CBA acquired ownership of the cba.com domain name, any emails inadvertently addressed to cba.com have been returned as \"undeliverable\", it said. During the dates highlighted by CBA, fellow big four member the National Australia Bank (NAB) came clean on a similar incident, admitting it had The email contained each customer's name, address, email address, branch and account number, as well as an NAB identification number for some customers. This is the second data concern the Commonwealth Bank has dealt with this year; it recently said it was In May 2016, the bank was unable to confirm that two magnetic tapes containing information used to print account statements were securely disposed of following the scheduled destruction by a supplier.

The state-of-the-art cybersecurity research lab is housed in the university’s Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) and features a multi-gigabit optical fiber network.  The high-speed network will provide new capabilities to carry out application and appliance pen testing, reverse engineering and advanced malware monitoring, according to the university.  Attack replay and monitoring functionality will also support research into DDoS attacks, it added.  “The CSIT Test Lab is one of the first UK-wide research infrastructures providing an experimental playground for both academia and industry to collaborate, innovate and share equipment, tools, experiments and data-sets,” claimed professor Sakir Sezer, head of connected systems security at CSIT.  “By combining all the new capabilities, the lab facilitates a highly configurable platform for many widespread communication technologies, enabling state-of-the-art ‘capture the flag’ and other red/blue tea’ cybersecurity challenge games and specialized cybersecurity staff training.”  A custom-built Cyber Range will enable researchers to connect remotely and share the facilities ad hoc with partners in other parts of the world, he continued.

For years, it quietly went along with the German intelligence services' insistence on sifting through the floods of data that traverse its facilities, until September 2016, when it sued them. Until a That traffic amounts to over 5TB per second of information coming from and going to places all over the world. The 'G10 law' also says the agency can only inspect international communications. However, De-Cix's 2016 complaint said the BND was scooping up the lot, without any targeting. It also said the agency was illegally monitoring internal German communications as part of those activities, as its filters for emails involving a .de address did not work properly.        Late Wednesday, De-Cix lost its fight at the federal administrative court in Leipzig against this strategic surveillance.  The court said the hub operator didn't have the legal standing to invoke the law on telecom secrecy, because it is only an intermediary for telecom traffic.       So the spying can continue unabated. The decision is good news for the German intelligence service.  As Edward Snowden revealed several years ago, the BND shares its findings with the US National Security Agency, or NSA, under a scheme that was at the time codenamed Operation Eikonal. In the grand game of global intelligence-sharing, Germany now still has its bargaining chip. De-Cix said in a statement that it finds it \"incomprehensible\" that the Leipzig court failed to deal with the BND's alleged violations, as detailed by the exchange. It added that everyone's privacy rights are now solely in the hands of the government's intelligence oversight committee. \"The sole responsibility for the protection of the rights of citizens and companies is therefore the responsibility of the G10 Commission, which apparently now also has to be responsible for the treatment of internal German communications,\" De-Cix said. De-Cix said it will now ask Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe whether it is actually obliged to implement BND orders that are \"formally correct\" but \"questionable\". A few years ago, Reporters Without Borders also sued the BND at the Leipzig court, arguing that the agency's surveillance scheme was likely to have scooped up the correspondence of journalists with their sources.  The court threw the case out, saying the NGO had not proved that the correspondence had been monitored in this way.  Reporters Without Borders then took the case to Karlsruhe, complaining about the breaking of the G10 telecom secrecy law, infringement of free expression and freedom of profession, and its lack of effective legal recourse.  However, the constitutional court rejected the complaint, again arguing that there was insufficient evidence of the BND monitoring journalists. Reporters Without Borders took its case to the European Court of Human Rights at the end of 2017.  It also still has a case pending at the German constitutional court about last year's changes made to the G10 law, which now explicitly allows the BND to monitor journalists' communications, in addition to removing the 20 percent cap on surveillance of international communications. Referring to the Leipzig court's latest decision, De-Cix echoed Reporters Without Borders' frustration.  \"The decision raises questions concerning effective legal protection: on the one hand, where, in the absence of detailed knowledge, citizens are unable to demonstrate their own concern and their claims are therefore dismissed, and, on the other hand, the obligated undertakings [ie De-Cix] cannot enforce their rights,\" De-Cix said. \"We always have a duty to our customers to ensure that strategic telecommunications monitoring of their telecommunications takes place only in a lawful manner.\" De-Cix added. Reporters Without Borders did manage to score one victory in its multifaceted battle against the intelligence services.  Last year it won the right in court to have journalists' phone numbers expunged from a database that the BND was compiling about everyone's phone connections.  The ruling also allowed anyone to request the same and, inundated with requests, the BND Although German security agency BND largely fought off an earlier lawsuit over snooping abuses, now the case is going to the constitutional court. The German government is trying to quell outrage over reported smart-home and car-bugging proposals.

More than half (58%) of buyers learned of these issues after the deal was completed.   One reason those issues aren't discovered prior to closing the deal is that most targets don’t allow sufficient access to discover cyber issues, said Brad Haller, director in West Monroe Partners’ mergers-and-acquisitions practice.  Buyers are not granted access to networks to perform scans. \"Couple that with the incredibly tight turnaround requests for diligence – which is a result of the market conditions – and acquirers are basically unable to perform the right level of rigor to the diligence process. Attackers are also getting more sophisticated and evolving quicker than ever, so the tools used in yesterday’s diligence process might not work for the diligence today,\" Haller said.     As a result, many acquirers are dissatisfied with their cyber-diligence, but there are additional causes of dissatisfaction. Haller said, \"Diligence partners can sometimes disappoint by not providing creative enough solutions to the cyber problems discovered. That is, a buyer always wants to know how a cyber problem can be addressed without throwing a ton of money at it but that’s often the advice they get.\"  In addition, Haller reported that they see a lot of acquirers choosing the wrong partner for cybersecurity diligence, \"for example, lawyers looking at historical breaches and past responses instead of technologists looking at how well-suited the infrastructure and tools are for the future.\"        \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                  \t \t \tPeople have known for decades that  \t \t \tUntil just a few years ago, quantum computers were a 50-year-old concept first introduced by Richard Feynman in 1959.

Singapore's law enforcement and financial industry regulator have issued an alert about rising fraud incidents involving online trading platforms.  Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), which operates under the Singapore Police Force, and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said 142 reports were filed last year from consumers who lost S$7.8 million (US$5.83 million) trading on unlicensed online sites. In comparison, 40 such reports were recorded in 2016.                       Questions remain over the kinds of services that will require a license and government officials' liability, but the proposed legislation is clear in one thing--that cybersecurity must now be a top priority for any business operating critical infrastructures in Singapore.                                           The unregulated trading platforms offered various products including foreign exchange, commodities, and binary options, Furthermore, investors often would have to transfer funds to overseas bank accounts held under names that were different from those operating the trading platforms. In addition, some would instruct investors to pay for their trades or fund their trading accounts using credit or debit cards, which could potentially lead to unauthorised transactions made on these cards.  These trading sites were not licensed or regulated under Singapore's Securities and Futures Act, which outlined rules licensees would have to observe and that were put in place to protect consumer interests, such as disclosure requirements on investment products.        MAS's assistant managing director for capital markets, Lee Boon Ngiap, said: \"There is no regulatory safeguard for investors who choose to transact on unregulated trading platforms...operated by unregulated entities whose backgrounds and operations cannot be easily verified.\"  He advised consumers to check and verify the site's credentials before proceeding with the trade.        CAD's director David Chew Siong Tai warned consumers against investment opportunities that promised high returns with assurances of little or no risks. \"These are likely to be a scam; if it is sounds too good to be true, it most probably is,\" Chew said.

Ron Wyden demanded action from the FCC and phone companies after a letter sent to him from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed the use of controversial 'stingray' technology near the White House, and attempts to exploit SS7 vulnerabilities.  Also known as IMSI-catchers, stingray tech typically mimics mobile phone base towers, allowing individuals to locate specific devices and intercept communications from them.  It’s a controversial surveillance tool which police and FBI agents have run into trouble using in the past, because it cannot be targeted enough to focus on specific devices and ends up catching data on innocent users.  Yet now the DHS has revealed that “anomalous activity” like that of an IMSI catcher was observed within the National Capitol Region (NCR), including in locations near sensitive facilities like the White House.  “The news of a possible foreign stingray near the White House is of particular concern giving reports that the President isn’t even using a secure phone to protect his calls,” said Wyden in a According to the DHS, law enforcement and counter-intelligence operatives investigated this activity and determined that “some signals” emanated from real cell towers, but that doesn’t explain all activity.  The The 40-year-old network signalling protocol has been known to contain serious vulnerabilities for years.  “I’ve spent the past year fighting to reveal what a terrible job the telephone companies and FCC are doing at protecting Americans from being spied on, tracked, or scammed,” said Wyden. “This letter is yet more evidence that these threats are absolutely real and they are already attacking Americans.” \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

These include one against DNS provider Dyn which took some of the biggest names on the internet offline by harnessing the power of botnets of compromised consumer-grade IoT devices like DVRs and CCTV cameras.  Realizing the Mirai authors were onto a good thing, others have followed, with the emergence of several new variants including Satori, JenX, OMG and Wicked.  While Mirai originally worked by scanning for devices secured only by factory default log-ins, Satori makes the code even more effective by adding remote-code injection exploits.  JenX removed various features from the Mirai code and instead relies on external tools for scanning and exploitation.  OMG goes further still by adding HTTP and SOCKS proxy capabilities.  “With these two features, the bot author can proxy any traffic of its choosing through the infected IoT device,” said Finally, the most recent discovery,“Within the RCE exploit, Wicked would include instructions to download and execute a copy of the Owari bot,” the security firm continued. “Often, the scanning and exploitation of devices can be automated, resulting in any susceptible devices becoming part of the botnet.”  The continued popularity of Mira-like malware makes prompt patching from users/IT admins and DDoS mitigation strategies essential, said Netscout.    \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 \tCyberattackers linked to North Korea have appeared to have withdrawn from attacks on the US industrial sector. Researchers from Dragos While Covellite appears to lack the means to attack industrial control systems (ICSs) at present, the APT is still able to gather intelligence on intellectual property and internal industrial operations. Researchers first recorded attacks against US targets performed by Covellite in 2017. A targeting phishing campaign was launched at a number of select US electric companies, of which fraudulent emails contained remote access tool (RAT) payloads used to conduct reconnaissance and maintain persistence on victim PCs. However, it now appears that the US has been crossed off the target list -- in what appears to be an interesting time to do so, as North Korea has a current interest in patching up its relationship with America.        US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are soon to meet at a summit in Singapore. The APT is still actively targeting organizations in other countries.        According to Dragos, Covellite's infrastructure and malware arsenal are similar to the North Korean Lazarus Group, also known as Hidden Cobra. Lazarus has been connected to a number of high-profile attacks, such as the 2014 North Korea was A technical analysis of the APT has also revealed that Covellite is making use of malware developed from Lazarus toolkits. Beyond this connection, however, Dragos is not certain of whether or not both groups and their campaigns are connected. \"Given the group's specific interest in infrastructure operations, rapidly improving capabilities, and history of aggressive targeting, Dragos considers this group a primary threat to the ICS industry,\" the researchers say. State-sponsored threat actors emerge from most countries, and with the backing of states and far greater resources than most individual operations, they have the potential to cause the most damage.  Another hacking group of note which has been linked to North Korea Dubbed Reaper, security researchers from FireEye say the APT primarily focuses on South Korea but has also been connected to attacks against Japan, Vietnam, and the Middle East. Reaper tends to attack government agencies and those in the chemical, military, electronics, aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors in order to gather intelligence.            Palo Alto Networks released its third quarter earnings and revenue report Monday before the bell, beating market estimates. The cybersecurity firm Analysts were expecting the security-software vendor to report earnings of 96 cents a share on revenue of $545.7 million. In what's likely his final statement as Palo Alto's CEO, Mark McLaughlin said the company captured market share during the third quarter \"at rates that far outpace the competition.\" McLaughlin is stepping down as chief executive and board chairman on Wednesday. Nikesh Arora, former COO at SoftBank and as chief business officer at Google, will take over. As for the rest of the balance sheet, Palo Alto's billings grew to $721 million. Product revenue was $215.2 million while subscription and support revenue rang up to $352 million.         In terms of guidance, the company expects fourth quarter revenue in the range of $625 to $635 million, with earnings between $1.15 to $1.17. Wall Street expects revenue of $618.2 million with non-GAAP earnings of $1.21 a share.       Palo Alto shares were up more than two percent in pre-market trading.

The speed of attacks is also a factor having a big impact, with Kurtz stating that the average time for an intruder to begin moving laterally to other systems on a network is now just one hour and 58 minutes, so “speed is everything.”     With regards to the best practice strategies organizations should implement to defend against increasingly sophisticated attacks, Kurtz pointed out that traditional security is based on a castle-like “defense in depth” approach which is, in today’s landscape, indefensible, as eventually the castle will be overrun.     Instead, he advocated a new approach of “defense in breadth”, using breadth of platform and breadth of protection.     Breadth of platform must “provide all of the elements of an advanced, adaptive and truly integrated security architecture,” whilst breadth of protection must “give all organizations access to equal protection against all threats from the most common to the most advanced, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.” \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                 Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

Jaya Baloo, CISO at Dutch telecoms firm However, this “quantum speed-up” poses serious risks to traditional cryptography, in that a current problem that would take “the lifetime of the universe” to solve could end up taking just a few seconds.  With quantum computers potentially emerging in the next 10-20 years, information security professionals must act now, Baloo argued.  “You need to ask yourself which threat model do you have and how long do you have to keep it safe?” she added. “I need us all as an information security community to get our hands dirty now.”  Those organizations that need to secure data over an entire customers lifetime could have a problem if they don’t prepare for the possibility that the crypto they use to secure it now may be effectively obsolete in a couple of decades, Baloo claimed.  What’s more, governments around the world including the US National Security Agency (NSA) are hoovering up encrypted communications with a “capture now, decrypt later” strategy which could see old state and trade secrets fall into the wrong hands in time.  As it currently stands, security pros could extend the lifetime of AES-256 encryption through the quantum computing era by increasing the key size, while SHA-256 and SHA-3 could still work securely with a larger output, claimed Baloo.  However, RSA, DSA, ECDSA and ECDH standards would no longer be effective, she warned.  Quantum computing could offer advances in everything from earlier detection of cancer to MRI scanning and even metrology.    \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r                  Cookies enable us to provide the best experience possible and help us understand how visitors use our website.

Cory Scott, CISO of Scott added that you want a collection of people with different narratives and different types of functions, but that “trickster” narrative was also important to understand how the next attack pivots, and you want an engineering wizard to solve problems at scale and not just do a manual review time and time again.  Christian Toon, CISO of In terms of internal development, Toon encouraged delegates to consider “giving people a career, a job and then give them something else” like training and education opportunities.  “People want to grow and develop, and give them training and meaningful qualifications that enhance your security team and treat them as individuals,” he said. “Look at every walk of life, every gender and you need to tell HR need to positively discriminate.”  A question from moderator Wesley Simpson, chief operating officerToon recommended looking at incentivizing those looking for a career change and encouraging those only able to take on part time roles, while Scott said that there are three areas to consider:  Having an inclusive and supportive culture, where you listen to your employees and understand how to measure culture.  The second is about hiring and getting the right type of candidates and an “unconscious bias” in organizations who don’t understand your message.  The third is about establishing ability with a wide group and focusing on the development of the organization.

There is a particular challenge in changing the mindset of legislators from the current stance: “that no politician is going to lose votes by being negative about technology.”  “We need to upskill our legislators dramatically if we’re going to face the challenges of the coming years,” said Lane Fox.  However, politicians and civil servants were upskilled in this way during the creation of the Government Digital Service and gov.uk initiative, so it is possible, she added.

You login, generate your malicious code and you distribute it, but the difference is, unlike the products and services of before where you owned the ransomware, it’s now an advertising referral scheme. So you generate your malware, you distribute it, and this other criminal gang receives the money and pays you 40% of the profits – so there’s no upfront investment, no difficulties in dealing with the digital currency and potentially getting caught, you don’t even own the people you hack anymore! That’s how commoditized we are – people have options on referral cuts on compromising our computers.” \r                     \r                 \r \r                 \r \r
