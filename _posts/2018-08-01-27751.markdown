As the Presidents Management Agenda presses federal agencies to refresh their customer experience capabilities, ACT-IAC has crafted a plan on how to deploy human-centered design strategies into those efforts.The Customer Experience Playbook lays out an The Trump administration has made But the playbook, authored by ACT-IACs CX community of interest group, focuses on the policy and culture challenges that must be navigated as agencies deploy new technologies. Philosophies like human-centered design must be part of the process, the report says.Improving the publics perception of government service is complex and will require that customer experience become a priority and focus within federal agencies, the report says. To change this focus will require a better understanding of the discipline of CX, a move toward a more customer-centric culture, workforce and skills, clear governance of the end-to-end customer experience, measures that change employee behavior, greater understanding of customer expectations and systems to integrate customer feedback into systems, to drive improvement.The report outlines a framework composed of plays agency leaders should undertake to incorporate CX into their organization:The report details strategies to implement for each play, as well as use-case examples where other agencies have deployed the practices. The goal of the playbook is to provide federal leaders with a flexible framework that can be tailored to multiple organizations, regardless of their size or mission.While this playbook is written from an enterprise-wide perspective for external services provided to the public, it can also be applied to improve internal services including acquisition, finance, technology and human resources, the report states. These services provided within an agency are also critical components of the CX ecosystem.The PMA has tasked the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget with its Cross-Agency Priority goal for improving customer experience through digital services.
