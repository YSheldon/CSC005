Above: FacebookHeres something of a curveball for your brain: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter have teamed up for a new open source project that would make it easier to transfer your data between online services.The The ultimate aim of the Data Transfer Project is to improve data portability, allowing users to not only download their data but to transfer it directly to any other service.Facebook, for example, DTPs stated purpose is as follows:DTP will enhance the data portability ecosystem by reducing the infrastructure burden on both service providers and users, which should in turn increase the number of services offering portability. The protocols and methodology of DTP enable direct, service-to-service data transfer with streamlined engineering work.The launch comes amid a series of data scandals involving the big technology firms. The U.S. is currently So the launch of a project that basically involves building APIs for the purpose of sharing data is curious given some of these recent scandals. However, this move likely ties in with one of Furthermore, the DTP may help these companies distance themselves from the perception that they are walled gardens locking their users into silos.Data portability and interoperability are central to innovation, a DTP In reality, few users will likely transfer their data from Facebook The DTP could potentially apply to numerous useful scenarios in the long run. For example, if the DTP gains sufficient traction, companies such as Spotify may be pressured into signing up. That could mean it would have to offer its subscribers an option to export all their playlists and listening history directly into a rival service. The same applies to other digital services, such as fitness-tracking apps, which are notoriously difficult to move away from without losing all your data.For now, the DTP is still an early-stage project, and there dont appear to be any existing integrations that demonstrate its potential, beyond some early works in progress. But the idea could certainly gain steam if enough developers and companies sign on.People increasingly want to be able to move their data among different kinds of services like these, but they expect that the companies that help them do that will also protect their data,
