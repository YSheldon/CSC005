If you use the same password across a number of apps and accounts you need to change it now, he cautioned. Introduce a password generator to ensure you have unique passwords across all accounts. And for holidaymakers home security, they should ensure they have a trusted neighbor keeping an eye on the property while away and alarms set.Unlike Reddit, Butlins reported the incident within 72-hours and has proactively notified all affected customers, so it should escape the wrath of GDPR investigators.
