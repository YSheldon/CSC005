At the last count earlier this year, itt But the FBI has never said how many investigations suffer as a result. In doing so, the agency would quantify the scale of the "going dark" problem. tt Int The FBI also would not say if the records do or do not exist."It's worthless to know that the FBI can't get into any number of phones if 99 percent of those phones weren't important to making their case," said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs lead at New America's Open Technology Institute, told "Members of Congress who are buying what the FBI is selling are just taking it on faith that there's actually a problem -- even the FBI doesn't know its extent, if there is one at all," she said. t We filed the FOIA request in October, when the FBI revealedt We also asked for the FBI's internal tracking data for the past five years, which former FBI director James Comey revealedt Sen.
