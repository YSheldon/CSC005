Login passwords for tens of thousands of Dahua devices have been cached inside search results returned by ZoomEye, a search engine for discovering Internet-connected devices (also called an IoT search engine).Discovered by Ankit Anubhav, Principal Researcher at This vulnerability is CVE-2013-6117, discovered and According to the researcher's blog post and to Anubhav, who explained the exploitation process to Once a Dahua device receives this payload, it responds with DDNS credentials for accessing the device, and other data, all in plaintext.The vulnerability has been known since 2013 and has been since patched, but many Dahua device owners have failed to update their equipment, and even to this day have continued to deploy DVRs running the antiquated firmware online.But while this sounds pretty bad, things are actually worse. Earlier this week, Anubhav discovered that IoT search engine ZoomEye has been indexing these Dahua devices in a peculliar manner."The matter of fact is that a hacker doesn't need to exploit this vulnerability because as ZoomEye scans port 37777, it passes these special bytes and cache the output in plaintext, so a hacker just needs to go to ZoomEye, create a free account, and scrap results to get the credentials," Anubhav told Anubhav has attempted to get in contact with the ZoomEye team to have this cached passwords removed or blurred from results. A request from The NewSky researchers says that he learned of the trick from a post Anubhav says he was told by the BrickerBot author that he used CVE-2013-6117 to hijack and brick Dahua DVRs in the past."Fresh devices keep on being added on ZoomEye, so even if Janitor [the BrickerBot author] bricked some in past, this issue still persists as ZoomEye currently lists recently added devices," Anubhav told us.A quick search from    That's around 30,000 Dahua devices running older firmware and ready for the taking, and we found them with just three queries.
