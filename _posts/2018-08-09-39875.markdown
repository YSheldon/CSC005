Others included a portal authentication bypass, unauthenticated information disclosure, and cross-site request forgery.The group reached out to the vendor on July 7 and gave it a month to fix the bugs before going public.The firm has now patched most of the vulnerabilities disclosed, according to the "The OpenEMR community takes security seriously and considered this vulnerability report high priority since one of the reported vulnerabilities did not require authentication, a Healthcare was the industry most affected by breaches (24%) last year, and also the only sector in which insider threats (56%) outweighed those from external attackers (43%), according to Verizon.Separate research from Organizations such as OpenEMR who handle sensitive data are a prime target for attackers globally and cannot afford to have any gaps in their cybersecurity, argued Keith Graham, CTO at SecureAuth Core Security.Keeping data available, confidential and safe isnt just a business issue  it allows healthcare personnel to provide the best patient care possible. This discovery should act as a warning to other healthcare organizations to examine their own cybersecurity posture, including extensive pen testing, and improve their approach to authentication.
