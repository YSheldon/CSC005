Edward Snowden. (Image: file photo)Five years ago this week, Edward Snowden handed over a vast cache of First, the world learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been Reporters have published the most explosive stories that focus on government abuse and unethical intrusions -- said to be In an interview this week, the now 34-year-old whistleblower -- wanted by the US authorities and now in exile in Moscow -- is But five years on, some are disappoined by how little progress has been made. Beyond a law nixing much of And, since then, the UK, a key ally in the NSA's surveillance efforts, has But where lawmakers failed to make any meaningful reforms, the tech industry -- also implicated by the Snowden leaks -- stepped up.The Edward Snowden revelations have rocked governments, global businesses, and the technology world. Here is our perspective on the still-unfolding implications along with IT security and risk management best practices that technology leaders can put to good use.Silicon Valley tech giants, keen to regain their users' trust after the leaks were first published, took matters into their own hands. Bound by secrecy and gagging orders where data was turned over to the government, the tech companies could only limit any such intrusive access in the future.The Snowden leaks inspired five years of technological change, knocking the NSA and its partners back after each revelation. Today, we have near-ubiquitous encryption across our devices -- from end-to-end encryption in messaging and calling apps like iMessage and Signal to full-disk encryption that protects the contents of the device, locking out the government Encryption was also added behind the scenes. After the government was caught In the space of a few years, encryption forced the NSA and its allies to knock on the companies' front doors with a legal order, rather than sneaking around the back, surreptitiously grabbing data without their consent. That gave rise to the transparency report, a Google-inspired change from the turn of the decade, which presented the number of legal requests the company received from the government to turn over user data. Twitter followed suit in 2012, and many of the companies implicated by the PRISM program began releasing their own following the Snowden leaks.Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Yahoo quickly began reporting their data demand figures to quell concerns that the companies were giving over bulk data to the government. And, later, cell giants and smaller companies began publishing their own figures.Now, transparency reports are almost everywhere -- and But where many have yet to see change is how private industry, including tech companies, handle their users' data. Tech firms began aggressively mining user data to serve advertising and the interests of third-parties, sparking concerns. These companies are largely unregulated and not covered by the same laws as the government, giving them near unfettered control over your data. Private surveillance -- building The Snowden leaks didn't save everyone from government surveillance, but they helped to spark a cultural shift where we reclaimed control over our private information by securing it. The leaks were also the catalyst the tech industry needed to put security and privacy first after years of rapid growth and a laser focus on money making.Whether it's irony -- or capitalism -- as much as the tech industry pushed back against government information gathering, many companies stepped up their own.Now with a new focus on how the vastly unregulated private industry handles user data, Silicon Valley may be soon in for its own reckoning.You can send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755–8849.
