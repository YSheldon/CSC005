Tricksters have been misleading users about the functionality of apps by displaying bogus download numbers tttttttttttttttIt seems that tricksters on The trick takes advantage of the fact that apart from the app icon and name, there is one more element the user sees when browsing apps  the developer name, displayed just below the app name. And since unknown developer names are no use for popularity-boosting purposes anyway, some app authors have been setting fictitious, high numbers of installs as their developer names, in an effort to look like established developers with vast userbases.We have discovered hundreds of apps using this and similar tricks to deceive users.

As Google Play does not offer a developer account verification service, any app sporting such a tag should necessarily be considered suspicious.Figure 5  Developers using bogus verified check marks to appear more legitimateThe tricks described in this article are simple, yet potentially effective, ways to mislead users, particularly those who choose apps based on popularity. While none of these apps were outright malicious, these techniques could easily be misused by malware authors in the future. Fortunately, the tricks are also simple to spot, if you know what to focus on:
