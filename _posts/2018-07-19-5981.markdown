I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!t Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Among the practices under scrutiny are a requirement that device makers pre-install Google's search app and Chrome browser app, in exchange for being able to include access to the Google Play Store on devices, according to the Commission.Google makes the source code for its Android operating system open and freely available to device makers. Roughly 80 percent of devices in Europe and worldwide run Android, according to the Commission.The organization's commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement that Google "has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine."The Commission said that Google must end the practices in question within 90 days or face additional penalties of up to 5 percent of the average daily revenues of its parent company, Alphabet.In a statement Wednesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company intends to appeal the European Commission decision.The decision "ignores the fact that Android phones compete with iOS phones," he said, while missing "just how much choice Android provides" to device makers, mobile operators, developers and consumers.Additionally, Pichai suggested that Google may begin to charge device makers for using Android if the European Commission decision is allowed to stand."So far, the Android business model has meant that we haven't had to charge phone makers for our technology, or depend on a tightly controlled distribution model," Pichai said. However, he added, "we are concerned that today's decision will upset the careful balance that we have struck with Android, and that it sends a troubling signal in favor of proprietary systems over open platforms."'We've seen that there are partners looking for an alternative solution and are really keen to do more with Ruckus,' says Ruckus Networks Global Channel Chief Raelyn Kritzer.At Microsoft Inspire this week, executives touted Azure's record growth in consumption and revenue and praised partners for helping it reach a new level of dominance.CRN breaks down the 10 hottest hyper-converged products making waves in 2018 from the likes of Dell EMC, Nutanix and Pivot3.
