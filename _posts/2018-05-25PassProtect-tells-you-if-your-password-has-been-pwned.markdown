有一个30GB的OktA数据库，因为不是所有的网站都会使用其中的一个，PassProtect当然也是可用的，通过你的密码在互联网上检查安全是否需要安全地完成。PASTROPE使用Cloudflare的扩展计算密码的Sh1哈希，从长远来看，从密码转移到上下文安全和生物特征将更好地保护我们。这意味着，当你试图访问一个真正重要的文档时，你需要使用多个因素，比如点击你手机上的推送消息“OK”或你已经使用过的设备上的指纹或扫描，这是一个已知网络上的补丁和反恶意软件保护的最新情况。但是，当你每天登录同一个站点时，从同一个物理位置使用相同的网络连接和相同的IP地址登录，而你所看到的并不是异常机密的，你根本不必键入密码。像Azure AD和现在OKTA这样的身份服务支持这种上下文安全性，因为安全性更有用，使得它更安全；人们试图绕过的麻烦的安全性非常困难。IT政策不应该强迫用户每90天更改密码，如果没有从密码数据库中被窃取或窃取。正如OKTA副总裁Rich Dandliker在公司最近的OktAN会议上所说的，强制密码更改的数量直接与写在便条上的密码数量相关。生物识别和硬件选项有其自身的问题；您可以丢失硬件密钥AN。几乎每一个生物系统从指纹到虹膜识别到手静脉打印到声音生物测定都失败了大约20%的人口（更不用说存储与生物特征而不是指纹图像相匹配的散列，因为你不能重置手指。如果数据库被破坏了。但是随着这些选项成为一个标准（通过FIDO和W3C），这是另一步远离正在进行的垃圾堆火灾，这是互联网密码。一个类似Windows Hello的组合，如果识别失败的话，它会返回到一个PIN，这是一个很好的折衷方案——即使它是一个短的PIN，因为它只存储在你注册生物特征的PC上，并且它存储在硅中。要打破这一点，你必须窃取PC和键入猜测猜测后，直到你得到它的权利。正如Okta的Alex Bovee在Oktaye所说的，“如果作为一个行业，我们减少了用户的攻击表面，就不得不物理窃取一个设备，这是一个相当不错的成就。”一旦浏览器和网站支持FIDO和WebAuthn标准，他们就可以基于生物特征和硬件来交换令牌。是登录你，你不必担心几乎一个网站是否泄露了密码。在那之前，像PASTROPE这样的扩展非常值得安装。
There's a 30GB database ofOkta's As not all web sites are going to use either of those, PassProtect is also available as Of course, passing your password around the internet to check whether it's safe needs to be done securely. PassProtect uses Cloudflare's The extension computes the SHA1 hash of the password, takes In the long term, moving away from passwords to contextual security and biometrics will protect us better. That means that when you're trying to access a really important document you'll need to use multiple factors like clicking 'ok' on a push message on your phone or a face or fingerprint scan on a device you've already used, that's up to date on patches and anti-malware protection on a known network. But when you're logging into the same site you log into at the same time every day, from the same physical location using the same network connection and the same IP address, and what you're looking at isn't unusually confidential, you won't have to type in a password at all. Identity services like Azure AD and now Okta support that kind of contextual security, because making security more usable makes it more secure; annoyingly difficult security is what people try to get around. IT policies shouldn't force users to change their password every 90 days if it hasn't been phished or stolen from the password database. As Okta vice president Rich Dandliker put it at the company's recent Oktane conference, the number of forced password changes directly correlates with the number of passwords that get written down on Post-it notes.Biometrics and hardware options have their own issues; you can lose a hardware key and almost every biometric system from fingerprints to iris recognition to hand vein prints to voice biometrics fails for around 20 percent of the population (not to mention storing a hash that matches the biometric features rather than an image of your fingerprint, since you can't reset your fingers if that database gets breached). But as these options becomes a standard (through FIDO and the W3C), it's another step away from the ongoing dumpster fire that is internet passwords. A combination like Windows Hello which falls back to a PIN if the recognition fails is a good compromise - even if that's a short PIN, because it's stored only on the PC where you register the biometric, and it's stored in silicon. To break that, you'd have to steal the PC and type in guess after guess until you got it right. As Okta's Alex Bovee said at Oktane, "If as an industry we've reduced the attack surface on our users to having to physically steal a device, that's a pretty good achievement."Once browsers and web sites support the FIDO and WebAuthN standards, they can exchange tokens based on biometrics and hardware to log you in and you won't have to worry nearly as much about whether a site has leaked your password. Until then, an extension like PassProtect is well worth installing.
