司法部（AGD）主张将澳大利亚的电信拦截法从电信公司扩展到顶级提供商。在星期五的联合执法委员会之前，AGD助理国务卿Andrew Warnes说这种扩张将有助于COM。BAT是“加密的挑战”，“坐在下面的义务”，因此，当你现在进行拦截时，通信可能被加密，并且你可能无法以可用的形式获得信息，或者你可能会得到一些需要时间来解密的信息。在紧急情况下，“这是我们所面临的挑战之一，政府已经出来说我们正在积极地致力于立法。”在星期五的听证会上，澳大利亚刑事情报委员会（ACIC）首席执行官也说。Michael Phelan说，由于新技术的出现，电信拦截的进程变得越来越困难，5G移动网络使这一问题变得更加困难。据麦克·费兰称，截至一年前，执法部门在侦听中处理的流量约占60%。当我们移动到像5G—4G这样的系统是有问题的，但是当你移动到5G时，当标识符不存在于一个设备中，并且他们使用动态IP地址，那么它将使使用它变得更加困难。“元数据跟踪，”麦克·费兰告诉委员会。“这是一个不断发展的问题，因此，我们不需要为执法人员能够继续拦截而失去任何人。”在听证会上，还包括澳大利亚澳大利亚犯罪学研究所的代表。英联邦检察官处长麦克·费兰认为，为了处理技术进步，立法需要更多的设备不可知论，这是因为“技术对我们来说太快了，立法要跟上”，麦克·费兰补充说，它永远不会太早。开始准备5G，同时“我们正在应对，但在地平线上，它会变得更糟，”麦克·费兰说，“立法仍然围绕着一个装置和一个人，而…不管它传播的媒介是什么，我们都在追寻部分和信息。所以，如果我们想拦截，我们想做的就是立法，“我想拦截通信”。“这些通信是如何传播的，这些通信的形式是什么，它们是数据，它们是声音，它们是在设备上，还是在任何东西上，我们都想要合法的。“为了给执法部门提供额外的拦截权力，尽管数据保留立法的目的是利用保留数据来打击诸如恐怖主义等国家安全威胁，但8月份的AGD报告显示，这是在进行期间。2015年10月13日，到了2016年6月30日，AGD报告说非法毒品犯罪涉及57166个授权来查看电信数据。其次是杂项、杀人、抢劫、诈骗、偷窃和绑架。恐怖主义犯罪的等级低于财产损失和网络犯罪，在此期间有4454个数据保留授权。
The Attorney-General's Department (AGD) has argued in favour of extending Australia's telecommunications interception laws from telcos to over-the-top providers.Speaking before the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement on Friday, AGD Assistant Secretary Andrew Warnes said this expansion would help combat the "challenge of encryption"."The obligations that sit under the "So when you now put on an intercept, that communication may be potentially encrypted, and you may not get information back that is in a usable form, or you may get information that takes some time for you to be able to decipher and use, and sometimes in circumstances of urgency."That's one of the challenges we're looking at; it's one that government has come out and said that we're actively working towards legislation on."Also speaking during the hearing on Friday was Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) CEO Michael Phelan, who said the process of telco interceptions is becoming increasingly difficult due to new technologies, with 5G mobile networks to make this even harder.According to Phelan, as of a year ago, around 60 percent of the traffic that law enforcement was dealing with in interception orders was data rather than voice, which he said will only increase when 5G networks arrive."When we move to systems like 5G -- 4G is problematic as is, but when you move to 5G, when identifiers don't exist for a device and they use dynamic IP addresses, then it will make it even difficult to use the metadata to track," Phelan told the committee."It's an evolving issue, so it's not lost upon anybody what we need to do for law enforcement to be able to continue to intercept."In a hearing that also included representatives from the Australian Institute of Criminology, Australian Border Force, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, Phelan argued that the legislation needs to be more device-agnostic in order to deal with advances in technology.This is because "technology goes too quick for us, for the legislation to keep up with", Phelan said, adding that it is never too early to begin preparing for 5G, with both "We're coping, but over the horizon it will get worse," Phelan said."The legislation is still framed around a device and a person, whereas ... we're after parts and pieces of information regardless of the medium over which it travels. So if we want to intercept, what we want to do is have legislation that just says, 'look I want to intercept communications'."How those communications travel, what form those communications make, whether they're data, whether they're voice, whether they're on a device or anything, we want the legislation to be technology agnostic."In a bid to give additional intercept powers to law enforcement, the While the purpose of the data-retention legislation was to use retained data in an effort to combat national security threats such as terrorism, an AGD report in August revealed that it is During October 13, 2015, to June 30, 2016, the AGD report said illicit drug offences involved 57,166 authorisations to view telco data. This was followed by miscellaneous, homicide, robbery, fraud, theft, and abduction.Terrorism offences ranked below property damage and cybercrime, with 4,454 data retention authorisations made during that period.
