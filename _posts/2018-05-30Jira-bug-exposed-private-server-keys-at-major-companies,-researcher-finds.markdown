(Image: ZDNet)Several tech giants and major companies are exposing private server keys, thanks to a bug in widely used development software, which could allow a hacker to gain a foothold into their corporate networks.The bug, found in Atlassian software like Jira and Confluence, lets anyone easily obtain the secret access keys to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance that the software is hosted on. It's because the software An attacker can use an SSRF attack against the vulnerable proxy to siphon off AWS metadata such as secret access codes, as documented last year Those keys in the hands of an attacker could result in a takeover of the instance, leading to data theft or destruction.NIST Although most deployments have been updated, many companies are still running legacy versions of the software, often hosted on a company's subdomain or are easily searchable. Security researcher Several companies -- and one US government agency -- have updated their deployments after we reached out.A spokesperson for EE, the largest cell network in the UK -- which recently left A division of the US Dept. of Health and Human Services, "Once we became aware of this matter, our team worked diligently to follow our security procedures," a spokesperson said. "We have confirmed that the issue is resolved and no personal data had been exposed."And, At least three companies -- a musical instrument maker, a footwear retail giant, and a sports governing body -- did not return several emails warning of the bugs, and remain vulnerable. For that reason, we're not naming the affected companies. It's thought that there are many other vulnerable deployments. Earlier this year, two Jira instances run by the US Dept. of Defense were fixed, according to For now, updating your Atlassian software sounds like the best solution.Zack Whittaker can be reached securely on Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755–8849, and his PGP fingerprint for email is: 4D0E 92F2 E36A EC51 DAAE 5D97 CB8C 15FA EB6C EEA5.
