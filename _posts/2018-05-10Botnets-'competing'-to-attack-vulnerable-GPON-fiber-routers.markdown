A fiber router. (Image: file photo)Several botnet operators are targeting a popular but vulnerable fiber router, which can be easily hijacked thanks to two authentication bypass and command injection bugs.ZDNet In other words, these routers are prime targets for hijacking by botnet operators.Now, a All five botnets -- Muhstik, Mirai, Hajime, Satori, and Mettle -- have developed exploits to target the fiber routers, but so far none of the botnets have successfully hacked and hijacked the routers.The security researchers say it could be a matter of time. "Fortunately, the current attack payloads from muhstik, mirai, hajime, and satori, have been tested to be broken and will not implant malicious code [...] and mettle's C2 server is now offline, although it could really finish the implant during its appearance," said the researchers.The routers, developed by The company said, however, that it does "not have direct insight to the total number of units that are still actively used in the field."Even though its routers are under attack, DZS has indicated that it will not fix the vulnerabilities, but will work "with each customer to help them assess methods to address the issue for units that may still be installed in the field." The company said it will "be up to the discretion of each customer to decide how to address the condition for their deployed equipment."Routers are a prime target for hackers to abuse because they are Earlier this month, both UK and US authorities warned that Russian hackers are Zack Whittaker can be reached securely on Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755–8849, and his PGP fingerprint for email is: 4D0E 92F2 E36A EC51 DAAE 5D97 CB8C 15FA EB6C EEA5.
