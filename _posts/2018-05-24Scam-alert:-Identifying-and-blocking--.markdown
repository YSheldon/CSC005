几天前，我的电话响了又一个来自“我的本地谷歌专家”的电话。我每天都会收到这些电话，有时在某一天会不止一次。虽然我总是封锁号码，但电话一直在响。我在微博上发了一封短信抱怨电话：不要叫我，大兄弟！令我吃惊的是，我从追随者甚至其他专栏作家那里得到了大量的回复，他们都分享着同样的沮丧。显然，这是一件事。我决定遵循我以前的老板曾经坚持的一个方法：“不要抱怨问题，找到解决办法。”显然，他从来没有遇到过博客。即便如此，那句格言一直吸引着我，所以我伸手去谷歌。事实证明，在2018年5月，该公司表示：“我们希望这会向其他诈骗者发出信息，我们将毫不犹豫地对他们采取法律行动。”谷歌还宣布，他们已经开发出了新的自动和手动技术来更好地识别谷歌账户。CAM的努力。“这允许公司采取行动，要么删除帐户或限制其功能。如果你代表一个社区或组织，谷歌可能能够派出一个演讲者，以帮助您的社区避免欺诈和诈骗。”很明显，除非你要求自动回调，否则谷歌不会自动呼叫你。这里是GooGe'sSo，如果你接到一个主动呼叫，而另一个人却不在另一端，不管录音说什么，都不是来自谷歌。挂断。即使录音说要按下按钮和人说话，也要挂断电话。如果有人最终连接起来，它就不会是谷歌人。充其量，你会和一个不代表谷歌的公司交谈，最坏的情况是，和一个罪犯聊天，试图欺骗你。根据问题，很难说这些呼叫者是合法地来自谷歌还是来自另一方。显然，如果通话开始于录音，你几乎可以肯定这是假的。但是如果对话开始时另一端有一个人，就没有简单的方法来确认合法性。在这种情况下，我的建议很简单：不要把任何个人信息透露给那些突然拨号的人。最好是你不参与，然后挂断电话。没有办法让这些呼叫停止。我一直在阻止他们进来的电话，但这是一个糟糕的局面。一旦你阻塞了一个号码，另一个电话就被用来打电话。谷歌现在说如果你在谷歌上“宣称你的生意”，你就会被骗子接近。这样做，因为在呼叫者ID上报告的号码不再与特定的陆地线路位置联系起来，并且很容易被欺骗，阻止呼叫只会让你走到很远。即便如此，我发现，自从我开始宗教封锁以来，骚乱的频率已经显著下降。另一个选择是把你的号码添加到国家不呼叫登记处，问题是，这些电话中的许多都来自美国以外的呼叫中心，或者不受美国法律约束。其他电话垃圾邮件发送者是美国人，但他们把他们的操作转移到足够的地方，以至于他们很难追踪和阻止。也就是说，如果你确实收到了一个关于呼叫者投诉的足够信息，FCC有一个机制让你这么做。当我们在不修理任何东西的时候，谷歌也有一个你可以填写的投诉表格。这种形式有助于谷歌收集有关电话的信息，但该公司正积极树立预期。他们说，“请注意，这个表单不会直接影响你将来是否会收到RooFielk。”如果你想做点什么，这里的底线是：骗子会骗取。不管你尝试什么，你仍然会得到偶尔的骚扰电话。我能提供的唯一安慰就是我们都在一起。不要让它增加你的血压或让你生气，你吓唬你的狗。挂断电话，继续你的一天。还有，嘿，如果你真的想看到一些东西，那就是：2018选举季即将到来。在美国，政客们使用自动拨号设备来调整平台是不违法的。看到了吗？我敢打赌这会让你振作起来。
 tA few days ago, my phone rang with yet another call from "my local Google specialist." I get these every day or so, and sometimes more than once on a given day. Even though I always block the number, the calls keep coming. tIn a fit of petulant peevishness, I posted a missive on Twitter complaining about the calls:Don't call me, big bro! Much to my surprise, I got a ton of replies from followers and even other columnists, all sharing their same level of frustration. Clearly, this was a thing. I decided to follow the approach one of my old bosses used to insist on: "Don't just whine about the problem, find a solution." Clearly, he had never met any bloggers. Even so, that aphorism has always appealed to me, so I reached out to Google. As it turns out, In May 2018, The company says, "We hope this sends the message to other scammers out there that we will not hesitate to take legal action against them."Google has also announced that they've developed "new automated and manual techniques to better identify Google accounts tied to scam efforts." This allows the company to take action in terms of either removing accounts or limiting their functionality.If you represent a community or an organization, Google may be able to send out a speaker to help your community avoid fraud and scams. There'sTo be clear, Google will not robocall you, unless you've requested an automated callback. Here's Google'sSo, if you get an unsolicited call and a human is not on the other end, no matter what the recording says, it's not from Google. Hang up. Even if the recording says to hit a button to talk to a human, hang up. If there's a human eventually connected, it will not be a Google human. You'll be, at best, talking to a business that doesn't represent Google, and, at worst, chatting with a criminal trying to scam you. According toThe problem is, it's going to be difficult to tell if these callers are legitimately from Google or from another party. Clearly, if the call begins with a recording, you can be almost positive it's a fake. But if there's a human at the other end from the beginning of the conversation, there's no easy way to confirm legitimacy. My advice in this case is simple: don't give out any personal information to someone who dials your digits out of the blue. It is best that you simply not engage, and hang up. There is no single way to make these calls stop. I've been blocking calls as they come in, but it's kind of a whack-a-mole situation. As soon as you block one number, another is used to call at a different time.Google now says that if you "claim your business" on Google, there's a substantially-reduced likelihood that you'll be approached by scammers. To do so,Since numbers reported on Caller ID are no longer tied to specific land line locations and can be easily spoofed, blocking calls will only get you so far. Even so, I have found that the frequency of disturbances has dropped measurably since I started blocking religiously. Another option is to add your number to the National Do Not Call Registry atThe problem is, many of these calls originate from call centers outside the US or are not subject to US law. Other phone spammers are Americans, but they move their operations around enough that they're too difficult to track and block. That said, if you do get enough information about a caller to file a complaint, the FCC has a mechanism for you to do so. Visit theWhile we're on the subject of not fixing anything, Google, too, has a complaint form you can fill out. This form helps Google gather information about calls, but the company is upfront about setting expectations. They say, "Please note that this form will not directly impact whether you will receive robocalls in the future." That said, if you want to do something,Here's the bottom line to all of this: scammers will scam. No matter what you try, you're still going to get the occasional annoying call. The only consolation I can offer is that we're all in this together. Don't let it raise your blood pressure or get you so angry that you scare your dog. Just hang up and move on with your day. And, hey, if you want something to really look forward to, there's this: the 2018 election season is around the corner. It's not illegal for politicians in America to use automated dialing devices to pitch their platforms. See? I'll bet that cheered you right up.
