A revolution in open-source software has drastically shifted the IT landscape over the past few years.Once the realm of hobbyists, most of the world's name-brand software companies and an ever-expanding number of innovative startups are now leading open-source contributors. Such vendors have recognized the wisdom in uniting to deliver powerful enterprise tools that fast-track adoption of cloud with greater interoperability, reduced costs, and accelerated development schedules.The open-source world encompasses many licensing models for governing collaborative development and release of new technologies. Some of the most notable projects are still maintained by individual vendorsÂ—others fall under the auspices of foundations established to shepherd their development.With companies like Microsoft, once a bastion of proprietary technology, having done about-faces toward supporting open source, it's clear these communities, and their solutions, will play integral roles in the enterprise in years to come.
