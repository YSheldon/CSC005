家庭谱系和DNA测试网站MyPrimes于星期一宣布了一项安全漏洞，攻击者在9200万多名MyS遗产用户的账户细节中做出了让步。在一个安全研究人员在第三方服务器上发现一个存档文件后，该事件曝光。92283889个MyS遗产用户的详细信息。存档只包含电子邮件和散列密码，但不包括支付卡细节或DNA测试结果。MyHeritage说，它使用第三方支付处理器进行金融操作，这意味着支付数据从未存储在其系统上，而DNA测试结果被保存在单独的服务器和管理用户账户的服务器上。我已经在2017年10月26日举行了。目前还不清楚是否是黑客攻击的结果，还是因为恶意的员工出售公司的数据。MyFresty称用户帐户是安全的，因为密码是使用每个用户独有的密码密钥散列的。“MyHeritage不存储用户密码，而是存储密码。“每个密码的散列方式，每个用户的散列密钥都不同，”该公司说。自2017年10月26日（违约日期）和现在，我们没有看到任何活动表明任何My遗产帐户已被破坏。“该公司在同一天宣布违约，因为欧盟的GDPR法规迫使公司在欧盟将在三天内披露任何安全事件。MyGrand表示，现在已经向一家网络安全公司伸出援手，以帮助调查该漏洞的严重程度以及黑客可能访问的其他系统。该公司还承诺推出双因素认证。2FA）用户帐户的特征，所以即使黑客设法解密散列密码，如果没有第二步验证码，这些将是无用的。毫不夸张地说，MyS遗产用户应该尽快更改密码。My遗产事件是最大的DA。TA违约一年，自去年的Erimax HAKE以来最大的泄漏。
Family genealogy and DNA testing site MyHeritage announced on Monday a security breach during which an attacker made off with account details for over 92 million MyHeritage users.In a The incident came to light after a security researcher found an archive on a third-party server containing the personal details of 92,283,889 MyHeritage users.The archive contained only emails and hashed passwords, but not payment card details or DNA test results. MyHeritage says it uses third-party payment processors for financial operations, meaning payment data was never stored on its systems, while DNA test results were saved on separate servers from the one that managed user accounts.Based on the creation dates of some accounts, the breach appears to have taken place on October 26, 2017. It is unclear if the breach is the result of a hacker attack or because of a malicious employee selling the company's data.MyHeritage says that user accounts are safe, as the passwords were hashed using a per-user unique cryptographic key."MyHeritage does not store user passwords, but rather a one-way hash of each password, in which the hash key differs for each customer," the company said. "Since Oct 26, 2017 (the date of the breach) and the present we have not seen any activity indicating that any MyHeritage accounts had been compromised."The company announced the breach in the same day it found out about it because of the EU's GDPR legislation that forces companies activating in the EU to disclose any security incident within three days of finding out.MyHeritage says it has now reached out to a cyber-security firm to help it investigate the breach severity and what other systems the hacker might have accessed.The company also promised to roll out a two-factor authentication (2FA) feature for user accounts, so even if the hacker manages to decrypt the hashed passwords, these would be useless without the second-step verification code.It goes without saying that MyHeritage users should change their passwords as soon as possible.The MyHeritage incident marks the biggest data breach of the year, and the biggest leak since last year's Equifax hack.
