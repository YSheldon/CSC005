根据GDPR的最后期限，一个人群研究报告，基于对531多个IT网络安全的调查结果，只有40%的被调查者说他们要么符合GDPR，要么在截止日期之前遵守时间，只有7个PrCE。NT说他们完全符合GDPR的要求。许多组织（80%）承认GDPR遵守是一个重中之重，但只有一半的人表示他们对数据隐私立法有知识，或者对法规有很深的专门知识。更令人担忧的是，鉴于GDPR的宣传数量，有四分之一的组织说他们对法律一无所知，或者只有有限的知识。“这项研究中最引人注目的是缺乏GDPR专家的工作人员和对工作努力的总体低估。“符合GDPR，这代表了几十年来数据隐私管制中最彻底的变化，”网络安全部门的首席执行官Holger Schulze和LinkedIn的信息安全社区的创始人说，这是该组织面临的主要合规挑战。缺乏专家人员（引用43%），缺乏预算（40%），和有限的理解GDPR条例（31%）。大多数组织（56%）预计他们大约有三分之一的组织说他们需要对他们的数据安全实践和系统进行大的改变以符合GDPR，并且超过一半的人期望只做微小的改变。AMS的主要职责是满足GDPR遵从性。他们中的大多数表示，对用户数据进行清点，并将数据映射到受保护的GDPR类别，是GDPR遵从性工作中的一个优先事项。其次是评估、开发和整合支持GDPR遵从性的系统。大多数组织内部威胁计划都没有满足GDPR报告准则。GDPR的“解释权”赋予欧盟公民不受单独基于自动化处理的决定的权利。约三分之一的组织表示他们目前的自动评估技术是“黑盒装”。这意味着他们无法解释算法是如何做出决定的。大多数GDPR相关数据都存储在前提下。但是，大约三分之一的组织在云或混合IT环境中存储数据，这使得数据的控制可能更加困难。
The deadline for complying with the GDPR, a The Crowd Research report, based on the results of an online survey of more than 531 IT, cyber security, and Just 40 percent of those surveyed said they're either GDPR-compliant or well on their way to compliance in time for the deadline, and only 7 percent said they're in full compliance with GDPR requirements.Many of the organizations (80 percent) concede that GDPR compliance is a top priority, yet only half said they are knowledgeable about the data privacy legislation or have deep expertise with regard to the regulation. What's even more alarming is that given the amount of publicity surrounding GDPR, one quarter of the organizations said they have no knowledge or only limited knowledge of the law."What is striking in this study is the lack of staff with GDPR expertise and an overall underestimation of the effort required to meet GDPR, which represents the most sweeping change in data privacy regulation in decades," said Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders and founder of the Information Security Community on LinkedIn, which commissioned the study.The main compliance challenges facing organizations are a lack of expert staff (cited by 43 percent), lack of budget (40 percent), and a limited understanding of GDPR regulations (31 percent). Most of the organizations (56 percent) expect their About one third of the organizations said they'll need to make big changes to their data security practices and systems to comply with GDPR, and more than half expect to make only minor changes.At most organizations, IT and information security teams have the main responsibility for meeting GDPR compliance. A majority of them said making an inventory of user data, and mapping the data to protected GDPR categories, is a priority in their GDPR compliance efforts. This is followed by evaluating, developing, and integrating systems that support GDPR compliance.Most of the organizations' insider threat programs are not meeting GDPR reporting guidelines, the report said. GDPR's "Right to Explanation" gives EU citizens the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing. About one third of the organizations said their current automated assessment techniques are "black boxed." That means they're not able to explain how the algorithms made a decision.Most GDPR-relevant data is stored on premises. But about one third of the organizations store data in the cloud or in hybrid IT environments, which makes control over the data potentially more difficult, the report said.
