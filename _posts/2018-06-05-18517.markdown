ÂLaunching cyber-attacks has never been easierÂ for adversaries who are adopting and commoditizing more and more sophisticated techniques traditionally used by governments and the military, he added.The speed of attacks is also a factor having a big impact, with Kurtz stating that the average time for an intruder to begin moving laterally to other systems on aÂ network is now just one hour and 58 minutes, so Âspeed is everything.ÂWith regards to the best practice strategies organizations should implement to defend against increasingly sophisticated attacks, Kurtz pointed out that traditional security is based on a castle-like Âdefense in depthÂ approach which is, in todayÂs landscape, indefensible, as eventually the castle will be overrun.Instead, he advocated a new approach of Âdefense in breadthÂ, using breadth of platform and breadth of protection.Breadth of platform must Âprovide all of the elements of an advanced, adaptive and truly integrated security architecture,Â whilst breadth of protection must Âgive all organizations access to equal protection against all threats from the most common to the most advanced, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Â
