法兰克福的De Cix是世界上最大的互联网中心。多年来，它一直与德国情报部门一直坚持在穿越其设施的洪水中进行筛选，直到2016年9月，当它起诉他们时，直到交通量超过5TB每秒来自各地的信息。世界。《G10法》还说，该机构只能检查国际交流。然而，De Cix的2016个抱怨称BND在没有任何目标的情况下挖了很多。该机构还说，该机构非法监视德国内部通信，作为其活动的一部分，因为它的邮件过滤器无法处理。星期三晚些时候，De Cix在莱比锡联邦行政法庭对这一战略监视失去了战斗力。总工程师。法院说，集线器运营商没有法律依据电信保密的法律，因为它只是电信业务的中介，所以间谍活动可以持续不减。这一决定对德国情报部门来说是个好消息。正如Edward Snowden几年前透露的，BND与美国国家安全局（NSA）分享了它的发现，当时的计划是代号为“运行电子商务”。在全球情报共享的盛大游戏中，德国现在仍有讨价还价的筹码。DE-CIX在一份声明中说，它发现“莱比锡法院未能处理BND所谓的违规行为”是“不可理解的”，正如交易所所详述的。它补充说，现在每个人的隐私权都只掌握在政府情报监督委员会的手中。“保护公民和公司权利的唯一责任是G10委员会的责任，显然现在还必须是RES。“德国内部通信的处理是可有可无的，”De Cix说。DE-CIX表示，现在将询问德国宪法法院在卡尔斯鲁厄是否有义务执行“正式纠正”但“可疑”的命令。几年前，无国界记者也出现了。莱比锡法院的BND说，该机构的监视计划很可能已经铲除了记者与其来源的对应关系。法院驳回了这一案件，称非政府组织没有证明信件是通过这种方式被监控的。“无国界记者”随后向卡尔斯鲁厄提起诉讼，抱怨G10电信保密法的违反、言论自由和职业自由的侵犯，以及缺乏有效的法律追索权。然而，宪法法院驳回了这一申诉，再次辩称没有足够的证据来监督新闻记者。无国界记者在2017年底向欧洲人权法院提起诉讼。此外，德国宪法法院还就去年G10法所作的修改案进行了审理，该法明确规定BND除监督国际通信监管20%上限外，还允许BND监督记者的通讯。莱比锡法院的最新判决，De Cix回应了记者无国界的无奈。这一决定提出了有关有效法律保护的问题：一方面，在缺乏详细知识的情况下，公民不能证明自己的关切，因此他们的主张被驳回，而另一方面，义务事业（即De Cix）不能成立。“他们的权利，”De Cix说，“我们总是对我们的客户有责任确保他们的电信战略电信监控只以合法的方式进行。”De Cix补充说。“无国界记者”在其多方面的战斗中设法取得了一个胜利。情报部门。去年，它获得了法庭上的权利，让记者的电话号码从BND对每个人的电话连接进行编译的数据库中删除。这项裁决也允许任何人提出同样的请求，并被淹没，尽管德国安全局在很大程度上击退了早些时候的窥探滥用行为的诉讼，现在该案件将提交宪法法院。德国政府正试图平息对报道的愤怒。MART家庭和汽车窃听提案。在禁止智能玩具之后，德国现在拒绝允许父母在教室里听的智能手机。技术联盟包括苹果、脸谱网、谷歌、微软和Verizon和雅虎的母公司誓言——所有这些都是被复杂的索赔所击中的。TY与美国政府的监控。在德国评论案中，极右翼领导人战胜脸谱网可能会产生国际影响。
De-Cix in Frankfurt is the largest internet hub in the world. For years, it quietly went along with the German intelligence services' insistence on sifting through the floods of data that traverse its facilities, until September 2016, when it sued them.Until a That traffic amounts to over 5TB per second of information coming from and going to places all over the world. The 'G10 law' also says the agency can only inspect international communications.However, De-Cix's 2016 complaint said the BND was scooping up the lot, without any targeting. It also said the agency was illegally monitoring internal German communications as part of those activities, as its filters for emails involving a .de address did not work properly.Late Wednesday, De-Cix lost its fight at the federal administrative court in Leipzig against this strategic surveillance. The court said the hub operator didn't have the legal standing to invoke the law on telecom secrecy, because it is only an intermediary for telecom traffic.So the spying can continue unabated. The decision is good news for the German intelligence service. As Edward Snowden revealed several years ago, the BND shares its findings with the US National Security Agency, or NSA, under a scheme that was at the time codenamed Operation Eikonal. In the grand game of global intelligence-sharing, Germany now still has its bargaining chip.De-Cix said in a statement that it finds it "incomprehensible" that the Leipzig court failed to deal with the BND's alleged violations, as detailed by the exchange. It added that everyone's privacy rights are now solely in the hands of the government's intelligence oversight committee."The sole responsibility for the protection of the rights of citizens and companies is therefore the responsibility of the G10 Commission, which apparently now also has to be responsible for the treatment of internal German communications," De-Cix said.De-Cix said it will now ask Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe whether it is actually obliged to implement BND orders that are "formally correct" but "questionable".A few years ago, Reporters Without Borders also sued the BND at the Leipzig court, arguing that the agency's surveillance scheme was likely to have scooped up the correspondence of journalists with their sources. The court threw the case out, saying the NGO had not proved that the correspondence had been monitored in this way. Reporters Without Borders then took the case to Karlsruhe, complaining about the breaking of the G10 telecom secrecy law, infringement of free expression and freedom of profession, and its lack of effective legal recourse. However, the constitutional court rejected the complaint, again arguing that there was insufficient evidence of the BND monitoring journalists.Reporters Without Borders took its case to the European Court of Human Rights at the end of 2017. It also still has a case pending at the German constitutional court about last year's changes made to the G10 law, which now explicitly allows the BND to monitor journalists' communications, in addition to removing the 20 percent cap on surveillance of international communications.Referring to the Leipzig court's latest decision, De-Cix echoed Reporters Without Borders' frustration. "The decision raises questions concerning effective legal protection: on the one hand, where, in the absence of detailed knowledge, citizens are unable to demonstrate their own concern and their claims are therefore dismissed, and, on the other hand, the obligated undertakings [ie De-Cix] cannot enforce their rights," De-Cix said."We always have a duty to our customers to ensure that strategic telecommunications monitoring of their telecommunications takes place only in a lawful manner." De-Cix added.Reporters Without Borders did manage to score one victory in its multifaceted battle against the intelligence services. Last year it won the right in court to have journalists' phone numbers expunged from a database that the BND was compiling about everyone's phone connections. The ruling also allowed anyone to request the same and, inundated with requests, the BND Although German security agency BND largely fought off an earlier lawsuit over snooping abuses, now the case is going to the constitutional court.The German government is trying to quell outrage over reported smart-home and car-bugging proposals.After banning smart dolls, Germany now says no to smartwatches that allow parents to listen in on classrooms.The tech coalition includes Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Verizon and Yahoo's parent company Oath -- all of which were hit by claims of complicity with US government's surveillance.Far-right leader's win over Facebook in a German comment case could have international ramifications.
