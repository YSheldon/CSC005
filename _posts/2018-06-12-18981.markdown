The other two organizations, Embedi and ERPScan, are apparently owned by Digital Security.TheIt also called out Russian efforts to track the underwater communication cables that carry most of the worlds telecommunications data.The United States is engaged in an ongoing effort to counter malicious actors working at the behest of the Russian Federation and its military and intelligence units to increase Russias offensive cyber capabilities. The entities designated today have directly contributed to improving Russias cyber and underwater capabilities through their work with the FSB and therefore jeopardize the safety and security of the United States and our allies, said Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. The United States is committed to aggressively targeting any entity or individual working at the direction of the FSB whose work threatens the United States and will continue to utilize our sanctions authorities, including those provided under CAATSA, to counter the constantly evolving threats emanating from Russia.The move comes as Donald Trump continues to advocate closer ties with the Putin administration. This week he called for Russia to be re-admitted to the G7 group of leading nations and blamed his predecessor Barack Obama for the countrys annexation of the Crimea.
