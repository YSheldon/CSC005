This drops even further for smart factory (32%), smart utility (31%) and wearable (30%) projects.Responding organizations suffered an average of three attacks on connected devices over the past year, according to Trend Micro.The embedded operating systems of IoT devices arent designed for easy patching, which creates a universal cyber risk problem, said the firms COO, Kevin Simzer. The investment in security measures should mirror the investment in system upgrades to best mitigate the risk of a breach that would have a major impact on both the bottom line and customer trust.While loss of customer trust (52%) and monetary loss (49%) were thought to be the biggest consequences of a related breach, loss of personally identifiable information (32%) and regulatory fines (31%) came some way behind. Thats despite the new GDPR, which could impose severe financial penalties on firms found not to have taken customer data protection seriously in the event of a breach.The significant investment in this technology across the globe is testament to the fact that IoT solutions can bring many advantages to businesses, Simzer concluded. But if security is not baked into the design of IoT solutions, and SDMs [security device managers] arent involved in the IoT implementation process, businesses could face damages far greater than the benefits this connected tech delivers.
