The arrest of a 25-year-old French man in Thailand apparently seals the fate of Rex Mundi, a hack-and-extort collective that operated since at least 2012tttttttttttttttEuropol has The latest in a string of arrests was made by Thai police, which acted on a French international arrest warrant and apprehended “a French national with coding skills” on May 18 of this year. This operation capped a year-long effort that also resulted in the arrests of another seven people believed to be the gang’s members, who were nabbed by French police in June and October 2017.Rex Mundi (Latin for “King of the World”) made a name for itself with multiple hack-and-extort campaigns that mainly victimized companies in Europe.
