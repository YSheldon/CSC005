In its quarterly earnings statement released today, Qualcomm said that in absence of Chinas approval by the end of the day, it will terminate the transaction and pay NXP a $2 billion termination fee.The company also said it would spend up to $30 billion in a share buyback program to placate shareholders.Qualcomms purchase of NXP was viewed as an attempt by the company to diversify and make it less dependent upon the cell phone market. NXP sells mixed-signal semiconductors to a large number of segments including the automotive and smart-home markets.Qualcomm has faced an uphill battle to close the NXP deal. The company had originally hoped to close the transaction by the end of 2017. But in December But in April it appeared that Chinas antitrust regulator was negative in its review of the deal causing many to speculate that Qualcomms purchase of NXP was being politicized because of the growing trade tensions between China and the U.S. At that time the two companies agreed that they would call off the deal if they could not win Chinas approval by July 25.This isnt the first time Qualcomm has been caught in the crosshairs of the governments dealings with China.
