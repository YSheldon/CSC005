Streamlining management will improve efficiency, reduce bureaucracy and increase accountability,” Senior lawmakers were quick to hit back, among them Democrat Mark Warner, who is vice chairman of the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee.“It’s frankly mindboggling that the Trump Administration has eliminated the top White House official responsible for a whole-of-government cyber strategy, at a time when the cyber threat to our nation is greater than ever,” he “Our adversaries are investing heavily in 21Ross Rustici, senior director, intelligence services, at “In situations where minutes matter, the most prepared person in the room almost always carries the day. In a room full of decision makers with no cybersecurity background and a general who is in charge of fighting cyber-wars, it is a foregone conclusion as to whom will have the strongest voice in the room,” he argued.“Every cyber-event will become a military issue with a military solution. Regardless of the efficacy of the position or those who occupied it, the fact that the position existed demonstrated a commitment to understanding, managing and responding to cyber-threats in a way that was on par with the other major global issues of the day.”
