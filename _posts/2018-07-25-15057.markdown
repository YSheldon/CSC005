LabCorp has not confirmed that the malware was SamSam, but News of the attack It has since been reported that the attack, which struck around 14 July, may have been more serious than the notification suggested.Quoting unnamed sources familiar with the probe, LabCorp's Security Operations Centre reportedly contained the spread of the malware in less than an hour. However, despite this, in that short window the malware is alleged to have managed to reach thousands of systems and servers, including hundreds of production servers important for day-to-day operations.Patient data was not thought to have been breached in an attack."Work has been ongoing to restore full system functionality as quickly as possible, testing operations have substantially resumed, and we are working to restore additional systems and functions over the next several days," "As part of our in-depth and ongoing investigation into this incident, LabCorp has engaged outside security experts and is working with authorities, including law enforcement. Our investigation has found no evidence of theft or misuse of data."If the reports are true and the ransomware was SamSam, several elements of this attack stand out, starting with the unusual aggressiveness of its spread even once it had been detected  clearly, defenders don't have minutes to mitigate, they have seconds.This has been noticed in previous SamSam attacks as a feature of its design, in which the payload is decrypted manually at runtime by a remote attacker with a password. This makes it hard to detect, let alone analyse forensically, when it has deleted traces of itself.A second is the consistent targeting of RDP and VNC in which the attackers hunt for and compromise remote access gateways that are protected by weak credentials.In the case of Finding open ports or outdated software versions isn't hard to do using public tools such as The final part of the SamSam playbook is the targeting of companies in the medical sector. Although the most infamous incident involving this malware was the On that score, attackers who use the nasty appear to have achieved a level of success. Ransoms are usually below $50,000, with some victims reportedly paying up, which possibly encourages more attacks.As LabCorp is doubtless finding out to its cost, the alternative is days or even weeks of disruption.
