That result also came in ahead of forecasts of around $6 billion in revenues.Amazons AWS business accounted for 11.5 percent of its parent companys overall revenues for the quarter, which was an increase from the less than 11 percent it accounted for last year.AWS operating expenses were kept on a tighter lease, which boosted net income by 80 percent year over year to $1.6 billion. This also came in ahead of forecasts, and accounted for more than half of Amazons $3 billion in net income for the quarter.Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told investors during the companys earnings call that AWS growth was spread across business segments.Our growth is coming from customers that span from startups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us, and many of them have gone  a large number have gone all-in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result, Olsavsky said, according to AWS rivals all report results from their cloud operations slightly different, so making straight comparisons is not ideal. However, both Microsoft and Microsoft, which is the worlds second largest cloud provider, The company also reported a 53-percent increase in its commercial cloud services revenue to $6.9 billion for the latest quarter.Despite the differing methods, Synergy Research Group said AWS is in a league of its own compared with its smaller rivals. The firm explained in its Revenue growth at Microsoft, Google and Alibaba far surpassed overall market growth rate, so all three gained market share, but market leader Amazon maintained its dominance as its market share nudged up a percentage point to 34 percent, the report stated.The overall cloud services market posted a 50-percent year-over-year increase in total revenues for the quarter. However, the four largest providers  minus IBM  showed a growing dominance of the market at the expense of smaller players.Collectively those four firms alone accounted for well over three-quarters of the sequential growth in cloud service revenues, wrote John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy. In a large and strategically vital market that is growing at exceptional rates, they are throwing the gauntlet down to their smaller competitors by continuing to invest enormous amounts in their data center infrastructure and operations. Their increased market share is clear evidence that their strategies are working.Photo copyright: Dan Meyer is a Senior Editor at SDxCentral, with a focus on containers, lifecycle service orchestration, cloud automation and DevOps.
