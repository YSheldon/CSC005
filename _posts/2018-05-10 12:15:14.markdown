IoT\r         \r         The Army Corps of Engineers is bringing the internet of things to waste disposal, installing 100 sensors in dumpsters at Fort Carson, Colo.\r \r \r \r Enevo's small, battery-powered, sensors will be put in dumpsters and containers where they will daily collect data on the temperature, tilt, and fill levels, providing data feeds that allow officials to avoid overfilled containers, spot trends and make predictions about future waste collection needs.  The company’s cloud-based platform uses advanced analytics and a dynamic scheduling and routing engine to determine truck routing maps that maximize resource efficiency and minimize travel distances.\r \r \r \r Sensor data will be sent over existing, commercial 3G or the Cat M1 IoT cellular infrastructure specifically designed for machine-to-machine communications. The network will be wholly independent of Army Garrison Information Technology networks.\r \r \r \r Enevo will be installing the sensors and providing six months of cellular subscription service, according to an Army sole-source Enevo's sensors and logistics platform have been deployed in 35 countries -- including a pilot program in Kirkland, Wash., where the city used them to decrease garbage pickups at City Hall.\r About the Author\r                     \r                 \r                     Susan Miller is executive editor at GCN.

It made the announcements in a May 3 \"all hands\" meetings between headquarters and the staffs of each data center.\r  \r \r \"The announced changes are part of DISA's ongoing efforts reduce the agency's physical footprint and align with federal data center optimization efforts, while continuing to meet evolving DOD mission requirements,\" the agency said in a statement.\r  \r \r DISA expects $695 million in savings over the next decade because of the closures and personnel realignments and anticipates cost reductions from tighter contract requirements for the operations.\r  \r \r DISA finds itself under increasing However, Capitol Hill sources called DISA's Computing Ecosystem announcement part of the agency's normal operational business and said the reductions weren't drastic. Putting the cuts into a larger perspective, DISA has thousands of employees at its headquarters in Fort Meade, Md., and just 30 full time and 13 contractors at its St. Louis office, the source said.\r \r     DISA launched its Computing Ecosystem program in 2017 to unify far-flung computing centers and optimize resources and capabilities across the agency.\r About the Author\r                     \r                 \r                      Before joining FCW, Rockwell was Washington correspondent for Government Security News, where he covered all aspects of homeland security from IT to detection dogs and border security.
