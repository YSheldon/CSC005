澳大利亚的战略政策研究所（ASPI）的一份新政策文件说：“如果网络攻击真的构成了重大威胁，那么政府需要开始思考它们，就像他们在物理世界中想到其他事件一样。”“这表明首相Theresa May在几天内公开了对萨尔兹伯里中毒事件的公开归因，并在随后的事件中做出了后遗症。她果断的行动也促成了一个国际联盟在很短的时间内，“它说。显然，这是一个严肃的问题，需要迅速的回应，但速度也是可能的，因为政府领导人更习惯于处理物理世界事件。他们仍然不了解网络事件的影响或重要性，或者已经建立了处理这些事件的方法。“T.T.TIGER注意到，尽管创造了一套T”，但在网络世界和物理世界中是一样的。不行动产生了自己的规范，或者至少是对不良国家角色的期望，即他们的活动是可以接受的，因为他们的行为没有成本，未来的不良行为也不可能有代价。T画师的解决方案是加快网络攻击的归属，尽快命名和羞耻，并创造一个可信的反应，超越这一点——理想地把所有这些作为集体多边行动的一部分。他说：“尽管归因通常是可以实现的，即使是困难的，但它似乎仍然要花费太长的时间——至少对于公开声明的国家归属来说是如此。”T延误可能是由于收集证据的技术难度；平衡公众利益以抵触情报收集的“来源和方法”的风险，以及“需要鼓吹政治责任来宣布谴责和采取行动”。“所有这些周期都需要缩短，”指针写道。公共属性，或“命名和羞辱”，可以是一个有效的工具，尤其是当集体完成。当包括澳大利亚、美国和英国在内的七个国家在二月将NoPETYA网络攻击归咎于俄罗斯时，这是有其局限性的。“命名”和“羞辱”对那些不关心他们被公开露面的国家没有什么影响，如果演员认为他们的权力通过对他们的行为而得到加强，就会产生相反的效果。“单独命名和羞辱会改变朝鲜或俄罗斯的行为，这是值得怀疑的，”指针写道。TPo指针调用状态以使用和扩展工具工具箱中已经存在的工具。他写道：“目前任何工具都可以用来施加后果，包括外交、经济（包括制裁）、执法、网络反应和动态反应。”有些“过去”在不同程度上被使用过，但效果不同，但不是一贯的和战略性的。有些像动力学反应，极不可能被使用，除非一个网络事件导致类似物理攻击的死亡和身体伤害。诚然，其他人需要一段时间来开发和部署，但我们必须有政治意愿在适当的情况下及时地使用它们。“例如，美国政府自2015年4月以来就有权实施网络特定的制裁，但只有U。他们曾两次在2017年12月对俄罗斯演员进行选举干预，第二次在2018年3月再次攻击俄罗斯演员。“要严肃对待制裁的威胁，必须以更常规和及时的方式使用，他们的目标应该被选择来真正地影响违反国家的决策。”ToPoor的建议包括缩短归因周期，或者如果归因可以。不要很快做出反应，将最终的公众归因与“至少一个可见的反应行动”相结合。他还呼吁网络安全“主流化”，并将其视为国家和经济安全的核心关注点，而不是“一个精品技术问题”。我们必须改变那些认为这是无成本企业的微积分。对国家发起的网络攻击施加有效和及时的后果是这一变化的一个关键部分。北约组织的网络联盟演习是最大的。随着网络战争的到来，每一个设备都成了战场。这就是你需要知道的一切。尼日利亚人，这些网络罪犯是高度组织化的。他们的骡子团队可以把一切从iPhone转移到乐高，而不仅仅是钱。他们能闻到水中的血腥味。新颁布的GDPR的关键要求的t色调是一个展示的努力来实施保障客户数据的安全措施。这个包包含六个可以自定义和实现的策略。T-TA联合商务部和国土安全部联合报告称僵尸网络需要工业和政府部门
 "If cyberattacks really pose a significant threat, governments need to start thinking of them like they think of other incidents in the physical world," says a new policy paper from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). t"It is telling that Prime Minister Theresa May made public attribution of the Salisbury poisonings in a matter of days and followed up with consequences shortly thereafter. Her decisive action also helped galvanise an international coalition in a very short time frame," it says. t"Obviously that was a serious matter that required a speedy response, but the speed was also possible because government leaders are more used to dealing with physical world incidents. They still don't understand the impact or importance of cyber events or have established processes to deal with them." tThe paper, titledt tPainter notes that while there's been progress in creating a set oft t"This is as true in the cyber world as in the physical one. Inaction creates its own norm, or at least an expectation on the part of bad state actors that their activity is acceptable because there are no costs for their actions and no likely costs for future bad acts," he writes. tPainter's solution is to speed up the attribution of cyber attacks, name and shame as soon as possible, and create a credible response beyond that -- ideally doing all of this as part of a collective multilateral action. t"Although attribution is often achievable, even if difficult, it still seems to take far too long -- at least for public announcements of state attribution," he writes. tDelays can be due to the technical difficulty of gathering evidence; balancing the benefits of going public against the risk of compromising the "sources and methods" of intelligence gathering, and "the need to summon the political will to announce blame and take action". t"All of these cycles need to be shortened," Pointer writes. tPublic attribution, or "naming and shaming", can be an effective tool, especially when done collectively. When seven nations including Australia, the US, and UK attributed the NotPetya cyber attacks to Russia in February, that was at tBut it has its limits. t"Naming and shaming has little effect on states that don't care if they're publicly outed and has the opposite effect if the actor thinks their power is enhanced by having actions attributed to them ... It's doubtful that naming and shaming alone will change either North Korea's or Russia's conduct," Pointer writes. tPointer is calling for states to use and expand the tools already in their toolkits. t"The current tools that can be used in any instance to impose consequences are diplomatic, economic (including sanctions), law enforcement, cyber responses, and kinetic responses," he writes. t"Some of them have been used in the past to varying degrees and with varying levels of effectiveness but not in a consistent and strategic way. Some, like kinetic responses, are highly unlikely to be used unless a cyber event causes death and physical injury similar to a physical attack. Others admittedly take a while to develop and deploy, but we have to have the political willingness to use them decisively in the appropriate circumstances and in a timely manner." tThe US government, for example, has had the power to impose cyber-specific sanctions since April 2015, but has only used them twice: Once in December 2017 against Russian actors for election interference and a second time in March 2018, again against Russian actors. t"For the threat of sanctions to be taken seriously, they must be used in a more regular and timely manner, and their targets should be chosen to have a real effect on the violating state's decision-making." tPointer's recommendations include shortening the attribution cycle, or if attribution can't be made quickly, couple the eventual public attribution with "at least one visible responsive action". He also calls for cybersecurity to be "mainstreamed" and treated as a core national and economic security concern, not as "a boutique technical issue". t"We must change the calculus of those who believe this is a costless enterprise. Imposing effective and timely consequences for state-sponsored cyberattacks is a key part of that change," he writes. t tThe Cyber Coalition exercise is the biggest held by NATO. t tUpdated: With the arrival of cyberwarfare, every device had become a battleground.
