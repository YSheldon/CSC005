Four academics from the Technical University in Dresden, Germany (TU Dresden) have created an app that detects and masks the hidden dot patterns that laser color printers secretly hide on all printed documents.These dots encode information about the printer hardware, the printed document itself, and the date of the print. Almost all modern commercial color laser printers add them to documents without informing their users.Most users couldn't care less about such dots, especially since they're not visible to the human eye. But for whistleblowers, they are a real problem, as they could help oppressive governments or shady employers track down the source of a leak to a specific printer, date, or time, narrowing down the number of potential suspects.To help users keep their privacy intact, TU Dresden researchers have come up with an algorithm for detecting these dot patterns and adding extra dots on top, masking and anonymizing the source of the printed doc.They released a Python CLI app that can perform this process. The app's name is DEDA, which stands for which stands for tracking The app can add small dots here and there, to make small partial alteration to a hidden dot pattern, or can blot out the pattern entirely to ensure full anonymity.In a Their reasons are tied to the fact that while hidden printer dots pose no inconvenience to regular users, they are a danger for whistleblowers, persons who sometimes leak crucial documents revealing appalling abuses of power."Every person should have the freedom of speech, which should also include uncovering unacceptable situations within companies or government bodies," said Timo Richter, one of DEDA's four creators."We believe that citizens should be aware of the existence of such codes, and the surveillance that they make possible," said Stephan Escher, another researcher involved in the DEDA project.Privacy-focused organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have warned about hidden printer dots since Printer dots became a mainstream topic in 2016 when US authorities The DEDA app is available
