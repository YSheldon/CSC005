麦格理电信集团旗下的TMQQuale云服务公司推出了一种全新的云服务，纯粹是为了存储健康信息。该公司表示，麦格理推出健康云是为了响应人类服务部（DHS）的一项政策决定而开发的，旨在保护其所持有的数据的完整性。DHS政策适用于第三方软件连接部门提供在线服务，如电子索赔医疗保险支付。麦夸里在星期二的一份声明中说：“这些连接到部门的ICT系统的云环境现在被授权满足部门对其自身应用的认证标准。”麦格理云服务集团执行官James Mystakidis补充道：“通过更新的政策，国土安全部正在展示如何改变ICT，同时提升网络安全标准。”“这是特别相关的，因为已经有很多关于供应链如何能够创建网络安全风险的讨论。”这是政府如何利用其供应链推动行业安全转型的一个例子。“T麦夸里政府于九月收到澳大利亚信号局（ASD）的认证，允许它存储高度机密的政府信息TePTeCTL。云服务的EVEL认证是目前ASD在其认证的云服务列表（CCSL）上批准的最高安全级别，它还包括切片技术和库系统，而健康云使用与CCSL认证相同的基础设施，麦夸里说，它打开了。政府对私营卫生部门提供者的安全服务。Mystakidis说：“这意味着澳大利亚人第一次能够保证他们的数据从一个健康软件公司的云服务转移到医疗保险系统将被端到端保护到同一个标准。”“卫生系统是一个行业提供一个必要的服务的案例研究，但它被广泛分散在许多地方的许多大小的私人和公共组织。在这种情况下，私人数据只与链中最薄弱的环节一样安全。“麦格理的声明遵循了卫生部与Vault系统一起工作的观点，以及敏捷数字，这是一个概念证明，即本周，珀斯的HealthCalt T”负反馈。“不公布，而是完全保密地直接传递给诊所，以帮助健康实践向前发展，”HealthEngy首席执行官兼创始人Marcus Tan博士在T中说：“我们给所有病人发电子邮件，评论他们的评论并提醒他们有POSSI。TTAN继续说，患者有时要求不发表适度的反馈意见，而他的公司“高兴地”遵守。他说：“我们并没有打算缓和任何评论误导读者，而在过去的三年里，我们很少收到关于我们如何评论这些评论的抱怨，包括那些提交这些评论的病人。”“用户信任对于HealthEngin来说是最重要的，我们正在对HealthEngEngEngress识别系统进行内部和外部的审查，以确保我们审查和公布患者评论的方式的清晰性、符合性和最佳实践。”资讯科技专员在该计划运作的前六个星期收到63宗违反资料的通知。澳大利亚政府的我的健康记录数据使用指南要求数据治理委员会逐一作出关于数据如何使用的决定。T TuSturaAuto安全云提供商Vault系统和BaskSu链启动敏捷数字具有联合的力量为部门提供跟踪健康数据研究的不可改变的记录。澳大利亚隐私基金会希望政府在共享开放数据的同时开发安全控制，并向负责调查数据滥用的机构提供足够的资源。TaTuSala正忙于隐私灾难，因为政府开放的数据倡议在不考虑如何正确实施隐私保护和数据匿名的情况下上线。
 tMacquarie Cloud Services, part of the Macquarie Telecom Group, has launched a new cloud service, purely for storing health information. tThe company said its Macquarie Launch Health Cloud was developed in response to a policy decision by the Department of Human Services (DHS) aimed at protecting the integrity of the data it holds. tThe DHS policy applies to third-party software connecting with the department to deliver online services, such as electronic claims payments for Medicare. t"These cloud environments connecting to the department's ICT systems are now mandated to meet the same standards of accreditation of those the department applies to itself," Macquarie said in a statement on Tuesday. t"Through the updated policy, the DHS is demonstrating how it is possible to transform ICT while at the same time elevating cyber security standards," Macquarie Cloud Services group executive James Mystakidis added. t"This is particularly relevant as there has been a lot of talk about how supply chains can create cyber security risks. This is an example of how the government can use its supply chains to push secure transformation through an industry." tMacquarie Government received accreditation from the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) in September, allowing it to store highly classified government informationt tProtected-level certification for cloud services is currently the highest security level approved by the ASD on its Certified Cloud Services List (CCSL), which also includes Sliced Tech and Vault Systems, whot t tThe health cloud uses the same infrastructure as CCSL certified, Macquarie said, noting it opens the secure service outside the government to private health sector providers. t"This means that Australians will -- for the first time -- be able to be assured their data moving from a health software company's cloud services into the Medicare system will be protected end-to-end to the same standard," Mystakidis added. t"The health system is a case study of an industry delivering an essential service, but which is widely dispersed across private and public organisations of many sizes in many places. Private data in such situations is only as secure as the weakest link in the chain." tThe announcement from Macquarie follows the Department of Health working with Vault Systems, alongside Agile Digital, on a proof of concept that usest tAlso this week, Perth-based healthcaret t t"Negative feedback is not published but rather passed on confidentially and directly to the clinic completely unmoderated to help health practices improve moving forward," HealthEngine CEO and founder Dr. Marcus Tan said in at t"We email all patients about their reviews being published and alert them to having possibly been moderated according to our guidelines." tTan continued by saying patients have on occasion requested the non-publishing of moderated feedback and that his company "happily" complies. t"We have not intended to moderate any reviews to mislead readers, and over the last three years, have received very few complaints about the way we have moderated the comments, including from the patients who submitted them," he said. t"User trust is paramount to us at HealthEngine and we are conducting an internal and external review of the HealthEngine Practice Recognition System to ensure clarity, compliance and best practice regarding the way in which we review and publish patient comments." t tThe Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has received 63 data breach notifications in first six weeks of the scheme's operation. t tThe Australian government's My Health Record data use guidelines require the data governance board to make case-by-case decisions on how the data can be used. t tAustralian secure cloud provider Vault Systems and blockchain startup Agile Digital have combined forces to provide the department with an immutable record for tracking health data research. t tThe Australian Privacy Foundation wants the government to develop security controls around sharing open data and provide the agency charged with investigating data misuse with 'adequate' resources. t tAustralia is charging headlong into a privacy disaster as government open data initiatives come online without considering how to properly implement privacy safeguards and data anonymity.
