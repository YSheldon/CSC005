Since the ransomware attack that impacted an estimated 200,000 computers, new research suggests that organizations across the UK are still struggling to deal with ransomware, none more than those in the healthcare industry.Over 400 IT decision makers at UK businesses partook in a recently released That number could indicate a false sense of security, given that 45% of respondents had suffered a ransomware attack. Of those, nearly a quarter (23%) actually paying the ransom. More than half of the healthcare companies polled (52%) admitting to having suffered an attack.ÂOrganizations still arenÂt investing the necessary time and resources in risk mitigation and recovery processes, leaving them with limited options in case of a successful attack. The healthcare industry in particular needs to be very aware of the fact that it is a high-profile target, with valuable data at stake, and take special care to ensure that defenses are in place,Â said David Kennerley, director of threat research, Webroot.In the healthcare sector, multiple attacks hit over one in four (26%) organizations. Of the 400 survey participants, 56% of respondents would consider paying the ransom. That number is smaller for organizations in the healthcare sector, with only 34% saying they would consider paying. Interestingly, only 5% of all those surveyed have stocked Bitcoin should they need to pay a ransom. However,Â 8% of organizations in the healthcare sectorÂ have acquired cryptocurrency.ÂA ransomware attack should be a blip on the radar that wastes peopleÂs time to restore from backups, not a week-long debacle of trying to restore service and deciding whether to pay the ransom or not,Â said Mounir Hahad, head of Juniper Threat Labs at Juniper Networks.While backing up critical data and testing backups regularly has been advised as a way to mitigate the risks of a ransomware attack, 36% of survey respondents donÂt have a regular backup system. That decreases to 32% when looking solely at the healthcare industry.Addressing the human factor seems to be one step that many companies have taken to mitigate risk. Kennerley noted that when organizations invest inÂ security awareness trainingÂ with phishing simulation tools, theyÂ are less likely to suffer from attacks than those who donÂt invest in employee education. Fewer than half of the respondentsÂ (46% overall, 42% in healthcare) reported that they have not held staff training on ransomware.
