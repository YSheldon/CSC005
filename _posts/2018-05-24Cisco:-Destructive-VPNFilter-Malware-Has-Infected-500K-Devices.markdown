They are frequently on the perimeter of the network, with no intrusion protection system (IPS) in place, and typically do not have an available host-based protection system such as an anti-virus (AV) package,” “We are unsure of the particular exploit used in any given case, but most devices targeted, particularly in older versions, have known public exploits or default credentials that make compromise relatively straightforward.”The modular nature of the malware means it could be used for a number of reasons: there are capabilities to “kill” infected devices, covering the attackers’ tracks, and to steal website credentials and monitor Modbus SCADA protocols.The group behind has created “an expansive, hard-to-attribute infrastructure that can be used to serve multiple operational needs,” such as obfuscating the source of a larger scale attack, stealing data, or launching a major destructive attack, Cisco claimed.To help them, the attackers also created a private TOR network to improve data sharing and co-ordination of infected devices.It’s unclear whether the campaign is linked to the joint technical alert issued by the UK and US governments The DoJ said it was actively looking to disrupt the threat.In the meantime, Cisco urged owners of infected devices and ISPs to reset to factory default and reboot them, as well as to update patches immediately.
