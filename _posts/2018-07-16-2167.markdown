Reported by the The report was compiled by the Interdepartmental Group on the Security of Ireland's Electoral Process and Disinformation. It consulted a wide range of officials and examined the experience of governments in other countries before drafting the report. Within it, there was found to be a low-level risk of election interference when votes were being counted, as well as being adversely impacted through either broadcast or print media."Overall, the assessment finds that risks to the electoral process in Ireland are relatively low, taking into account factors already in place," the report states. "It is recognized, however, that the spread of disinformation and the risk of cyber-attacks on the electoral system pose more substantial risks."However, a 2018 study conducted by MIT found that fake news reached more people, penetrated deeper into social networks and spread much faster than accurate stories.
