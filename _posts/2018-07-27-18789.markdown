US cyber-security firm Symantec published a report this week detailing the attacks of a newly discovered cyber-espionage group that it internally refers to as Leafminer.This group or APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) has been active since at least early 2017. Symantec says its telemetry detected malware associated with this group's infrastructure on at least 44 computers in several countries, such as Saudi Arabia (28), Lebanon (8), Israel (3), and Kuwait (1)  for four systems researchers couldn't determine the country of origin.While investigating this group, Symantec says it also managed to gain access to one of its operational servers, used for phishing and malware distribution.On this server, security researchers say they found a list of organizations the group targeted with scans to identify weak points for future attacks.The list contained data on 809 organizations located in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, and Afghanistan. The list was written in Farsi and was grouped by geography and industry vertical, with targets spread across a wide range of sectors, such as financial, government, energy, airlines, and others.The server to which researchers gained access to last month by accessing the same PHP web shell attackers were using, also contained 112 files, including malware, logs, and other attack tools.During its investigation of these tools, adjacent Leafminer infrastructure, and past attacks, Symantec says it detected three preferred methods of attacks employed by the group.The APT's members would (1) compromise web servers to use for watering hole attacks to trick users into installing malware; they would (2) scan vulnerable networks and deploy exploits to infect systems on their own; or they'd (3) use dictionary attacks in attempts to guess the logins of targeted networks, also to manually deploy malware on compromised systems.The group didn't adhere or follow any particular pattern but often used what worked. They took the same approach when it came to malware.Leafminer used custom-built malware, but also "lived off the land" by utilizing tools already installed on infected systems.The group also had its ear to the ground when it came to the most recent developments in the infosec community. When the Shadow Brokers When researchers discovered and detailed the When Symantec published a report on the techniques of "The group appears to be based in Iran and seems to be eager to learn from and capitalize on tools and techniques used by more advanced threat actors," Symantec said."However, Leafminers eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the part of the attackers, a conclusion thats supported by the groups poor operational security.""[The group] made a major blunder in leaving a staging server publicly accessible, exposing the groups entire arsenal of tools," experts added. "That one misstep provided us with a valuable trove of intelligence to help us better defend our customers against further Leafminer attacks."
