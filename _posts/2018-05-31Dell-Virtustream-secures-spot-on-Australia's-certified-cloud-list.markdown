TDLE虚拟流是最新的全球播放器，以确保在澳大利亚信号局（ASD）认证的云服务列表（CCSL）上的一个点。作为上市的结果，戴尔科技拥有的公司现在能够在其本地戴尔虚拟流云上托管未分类的传播限制标记（DLM）政府信息。TVixStudio加入亚马逊Web服务（AWS）、教育服务澳大利亚、IBM、麦格理政府、微软、Salesforce、Service Neo、切片技术和库系统以提供未分类的DLM分类。九月，麦格理政府（MigQuee Guffic）的一部分加入了这两家公司，微软公司的认证是在上周的一个星期内被问及，微软Azure云存储在澳大利亚实例中的信息是否能够被海外员工访问。作为CCSL的要求，数据只能在澳大利亚中访问。MacGibbon说：“我很满意，微软Azure，在其由信号局认证的保护形式，或者信号局的澳大利亚网络安全中心将被存储在澳大利亚。”“数据可以驻留在世界任何地方，你可以要求数据留在澳大利亚，但它并不总是使它更安全，它是在一个特定的地理…我们在澳大利亚持有数据是很好的，这意味着数据在澳大利亚法律下，这意味着机构和其他人有更多的机会访问它，其他国家的机构理论上无法访问这些数据。UDE访问位于澳大利亚的数据，他说，微软的工作人员将有权获得数据将“适当清除”感到满意。当被问及ASD是否要求该提供商在澳大利亚设立CSCSL时，麦格博说“不一定”。他说：“这取决于体系结构，它取决于体系结构中的缓和，以及政策和程序，这很重要，我澄清了它，而不是像某些人所描绘的那样黑和白。”戴尔澳大利亚年度财务结果本周，澳大利亚证券和投资委员会（IsCommission）报告称，戴尔的当地分支机构支付了2280万澳元的税款，部分解决了其出色的ATO法案。它的能力围绕着高度管制的工作量和戴尔在医疗领域的影响力，虚拟流很好地提供了医疗保健专用云。TT参议员担心微软已经出现了受保护水平的ASD认证，尽管位于澳大利亚之外，Alastair MacGibbon将该公司标记为政府多年来的“值得信赖”的合作伙伴。当你在公共服务中拥有大部分的网络人才时，你为什么要推迟一个没有网络安全团队的机构呢？据国防部执法和网络安全部部长安古斯泰勒说，理解网络安全的严重性的TA总理与跨政府和公私信息共享倡议相结合，已经将澳大利亚推向了前列。Twitter的新报告显示，IT高管担心错过云业务的进展。
 tDell Virtustream is the latest global player to secure a spot on the Australian Signals Directorate's (ASD) Certified Cloud Services List (CCSL). tAs a result of the listing, the Dell Technologies-owned company is now able to host unclassified dissemination limiting marker (DLM) government information on its local Dell Virtustream Cloud. tVirtustream joins Amazon Web Services (AWS), Education Services Australia, IBM, Macquarie Government, Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Sliced Tech, and Vault Systems in offering Unclassified DLM classification. t tThe companies were joined in September by Macquarie Government, part of the Macquarie Telecom Group, intMicrosoft's accreditation was last weektMacGibbon was asked whether the information stored on the Australian instance of the Microsoft Azure Cloud will be able to be accessed by overseas staff, as a requirement of the CCSL is that the data be accessed only in Australia. t"I am satisfied that Microsoft Azure, in its protected form as certified by the Signals Directorate -- or the Australian Cyber Security Centre within the Signals Directorate -- will be stored in Australia," MacGibbon said. t"Data can reside anywhere in the world, you can demand data stay in Australia but it doesn't always make it more secure that it's in a particular geography ... it's good that we hold data in Australia, that means that data comes under Australian law, that means that agencies and others have more access to it and other country's agencies theoretically don't have access to that data." tMacGibbon, refusing to answer specifically if Microsoft staff overseas could access data located in Australia, said he is satisfied that the Microsoft staff that will have access to data will be "appropriately cleared". tWhen asked if the ASD requires the provider to be based in Australia to be CSSL approved, MacGibbon said "not necessarily". t"It depends on the architecture and it depends on the mitigations in place in an architecture, and the policies and procedures -- it's important that I clarify it -- therefore it's not as black and white as some people would portray it," he said.Dell Australia made its annual financial results available to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission this week, reporting The local arm of Dell paid AU$22.8 million in tax last year, partially settling its outstanding ATO bill. t tWith its capabilities around highly regulated workloads and Dell's reach in the healthcare sector, Virtustream is well poised to offer a healthcare-specific cloud. t t tSenators are concerned that Microsoft has emerged with protected-level ASD certification, despite being located outside of Australia, with Alastair MacGibbon labelling the company a 'trusted' partner of government for many years. t tWhen you have most of the cyber talent in the public service, why should you defer to an agency without a cybersecurity team? t tA prime minister that understands the seriousness of cybersecurity combined with cross-government and public-private information sharing initiatives has sent Australia to the fore, according to Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Angus Taylor. t tA new report from Commvault shows that IT executives are concerned about missing out on cloud advancements in their business.
