ÂItÂs brilliance is itÂs ubiquitous applicability to all of us Â stealing credit cards, targeting specific data, going after usernames and passwords, and ransomware struck on the gold of a model where they [attackers] donÂt need to care about what data you have, just that you care about your data.ÂSince January, thereÂs been a series of campaigns that are worth paying attention to,Â he said. "They are ransomware-as-a service campaigns offering some interesting new features."An example Lyne pointed to was a Âweb-based interface where you can set some options, customize the ransom price, the address and so on, click build and download and get delivered a nice, constructed up-to-date piece of malware that authors have put effort into making sure the security community isnÂt going to detect.ÂTheyÂve even started giving security advice: Âwe recommend you to download the file without the xe extension so you donÂt accidently run it!ÂAnother new ransomware service Lyne highlighted is one that is Âfree for download and use Â so we have Âfremium ransomwareÂ Â who wants to pay for a service in 2018? You login, generate your malicious code and you distribute it, but the difference is, unlike the products and services of before where you owned the ransomware, itÂs now an advertising referral scheme. So you generate your malware, you distribute it, and this other criminal gang receives the money and pays you 40% of the profits Â so thereÂs no upfront investment, no difficulties in dealing with the digital currency and potentially getting caught, you donÂt even own the people you hack anymore! ThatÂs how commoditized we are Â people have options on referral cuts on compromising our computers.Â
