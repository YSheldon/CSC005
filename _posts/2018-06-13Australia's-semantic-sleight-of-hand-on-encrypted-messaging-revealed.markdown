“政府不会授权后门。也就是说，政府不会要求将固有的弱点建立在加密中。”2017年8月4日，为澳大利亚当时最喜欢的司法部长George Brandis QC准备的一份简报指出：“澳大利亚政府不会立法削弱SEC。”设备或通信的安全性。澳大利亚政府将通过与国际合作伙伴合作，特别是五方情报合作伙伴和更广泛的全球社区来解决这个问题。与适当当局的沟通是一个“已确立的原则”，政府只是“使现有法律义务及时更新”。“政府计划延长目前适用于国内运营商和运输服务的合理协助义务。“所有的公司都会在澳大利亚提供通讯服务和设备，”这张纸条说，“这种援助将延伸到消除电子保护的形式，使之合理、实用和成比例。”例如，在某些情况下，供应商可以开发技术解决方案，允许执法机构合法地获得关键的、加密的信息，或提供信息以协助机构自己找到这些技术解决方案。“Fairfax媒体报道的大部分猜测都集中在政府是否计划授权后门，”[A] 2017年7月14日的《脸谱网》文章报道说，“削弱加密系统意味着削弱所有人。”E.的媒体报道也关注了“后门”的含义，尤其是在较小的技术出版物中。“你的作家是那些专注于什么构成后门的人之一，而对于我来说，意思是清楚的。这是一种故意创建的方法，供他人访问将被保护的数据。在通信的情况下，这意味着除了发送者或接收者以外的其他人的访问。因此，重要的是要注意，在2017发布的文件中，并且实际上，先前引用的简报指出，拟议的立法将“确保提供COM的公司。澳大利亚的通信服务和设备有义务协助机构，包括解密，并允许各机构使用可替代的能力，如监视设备和计算机网络开发。还有一个奇怪的短语：“排除电子专业的形式。”这似乎支持我的观点，与其说是一场“数学战争”，不如说是一场与信息产业结构的斗争。如果你可以通过设备的操作系统访问发送者的原始击键，或者在收件人的设备上解密消息，则不需要攻击明文消息，在星期二发布的最早的文件是电子邮件日期。2015年11月27日，来自AGD的副国务卿Katherine Jones被称为国家安全和刑事司法小组。电子邮件被分类为“保护敏感：内阁”。关键的细节被修改，比如接受者和机构被带入圈子。但这表明，没有任何讨论是新的，AGD意识到“技术和更广泛的环境都有了显著的改变”。“我们已经在更广泛的计划的背景下，对新的挑战进行了初步的思考。”英国和美国最近的事态发展表明，这些管辖区已经摆脱了后门“骨架钥匙”的解决方案。“因此，如果所有这些都在2015被知晓和讨论，为什么我们还没有看到任何立法草案？为什么政府对它计划做的这么谨慎？也许是因为政府的注意力分散了，也许是因为政府与国际合作伙伴以及科技产业之间的讨论比预期的要慢得多，或者可能是因为起草立法很困难。泰勒说，这项立法的磋商将在未来几周内开始。T型隐匿性手机是刑事侦查的主要障碍。联邦调查局现在承认这个问题比原先报道的要小得多。科技联盟包括苹果、脸谱网、谷歌、微软、Verizon和雅虎的母公司誓言——所有这些都是由于与美国政府的监视相混淆而引起的。这位前微软高管的想法在面对专家审查时崩溃了。TTeleGrad的律师告诉ZDN
"The government will not mandate backdoors. That is, the government will not require that inherent weaknesses be built into encryption," said a briefing note prepared for Australia's then-favourite attorney-general, Senator George Brandis QC, on August 4, 2017.The note is one of "The Australian government will not legislate to weaken the security of devices or communications. The Australian government will address this problem by working and collaborating with international partners, particularly the Five Eyes intelligence partners and with the broader global community," the note said.It stressed that law enforcement and intelligence agencies being able to access people's communications with appropriate authority is a "well-established principle", and that the government is merely "bringing existing legal obligations up to date"."The government plans to extend the reasonable assistance obligation that currently applies to domestic carriers and carriage service providers to all companies providing communications services and devices in Australia," the note said."That assistance would extend to removing forms of electronic protection where reasonable, practicable and proportionate. For example, in some cases, providers may be able to develop technical solutions that permit law enforcement agencies to lawfully obtain critical, yet encrypted information, or provide information to assist agencies to find those technical solutions themselves."The note reveals that the government is concerned about that loaded word "backdoor"."Much of the media speculation has centred on whether the government is planning to mandate backdoors," it said."[A] 14 July 2017 Fairfax article reported Facebook as saying that 'weakening encrypted systems for them would mean weakening it for everyone.' Media reporting has also been focused on the meaning of what constitutes a 'backdoor', particularly in smaller technology publications."Your writer is one of those who's been focused on the meaning of what constitutes a backdoor, and for mine the meaning is clear. It's a method, created deliberately, for someone to access data that would otherwise be protected. In the case of a communication, that means access by someone other than the sender or the recipient.It's therefore important to note that in the released document from 2017, and in Indeed, the briefing note quoted earlier stated that the proposed legislation would "ensure companies that provide communications services and devices in Australia have an obligation to assist agencies, including with decryption", and would "allow agencies to use alternative capabilities, like surveillance devices and computer network exploitation".There's also that curious phrase "removing forms of electronic protection".This would seem to support my It's not so much a "war on maths" as a battle against the structure of the messaging industry, or aspects thereof. You don't need to attack encryption if you can access the plaintext message by, say, accessing the sender's raw keystrokes through the device's operating system, or looking at the screen as the message is decrypted on the recipient's device.The earliest document released on Tuesday is an email dated November 27, 2015, from Katherine Jones, deputy secretary of what was then called the National Security and Criminal Justice Group at AGD.The email is classified "PROTECTED Sensitive: Cabinet". Key details are redacted, such as the recipients, and the agencies being brought into loop. But it shows that none of this discussion is new, with AGD being aware that "both the technology and broader environment has [sic] changed significantly"."We have undertaken some preliminary thinking about the new challenges in the context of broader plans to improve the "In addition, I am mindful that recent developments in the UK and US indicate that those jurisdictions have moved away from the idea of backdoor 'skeleton keys' as a solution."So if all this was known and discussed in 2015, why have we still not seen any draft legislation? And why has the government been so cagey about what it plans to do?Perhaps it's because the government has been distracted by the Perhaps it's because the Perhaps it's because discussions between the government and its international partners, and with the tech industry, are moving more slowly than hoped.Or perhaps it's just because it's difficult to draft legislation which can make it all work.According to Taylor, the consultation on that legislation will start "in the coming weeks". t tEncrypted cell phones were a major obstacle to criminal investigation. The FBI now admits the problem was much smaller than they'd originally reported. t tThe tech coalition includes Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Verizon and Yahoo's parent company Oath - all of which were hit by claims of complicity with US government's surveillance. t tThe former Microsoft executive's idea collapsed in the face of expert scrutiny. t tTelegram's lawyer told ZDNet that Russia's demand for the app's encryption keys is "unconstitutional." t tNew Android security features for the Pixel 2 prevent attackers from installing malicious firmware on the security module in a lost or stolen device. t tBitLocker, an encryption program from Microsoft, offers data protection for the whole disk in an efficient method that is easy to implement, seamless to the user, and can be managed by systems admins.
