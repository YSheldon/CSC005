MyHeritage does not store user passwords, but rather a one-way hash of each password, in which the hash key differs for each customer. This means that anyone gaining access to the hashed passwords does not have the actual passwords.”The firm has acted swiftly to set up an incident response team and an independent forensic review and said it will be rolling out 2FA to users soon. There’s also a 24/7 security customer support team on hand to answer any questions.In the meantime, it urged users to change their passwords.Commentators were broadly sympathetic to MyHeritage, claiming it did most of the security basics right.“This breach of MyHeritage seems to be the rare instance in which a company in possession of sensitive data adhered to some of the best practices in password posture by not storing them in plain text but as one-way hashes,” said
