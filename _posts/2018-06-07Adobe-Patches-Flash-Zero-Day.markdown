Adobe has issued a security update for Flash Player today to patch a zero-day vulnerability exploited by attackers in the wild.The vulnerability was discovered and independently reported by several security firms —ICEBRG, Tencent, and two security divisions from Chinese cyber-security giant Qihoo 360.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-5002, impacts Adobe Flash Player 29.0.0.171 and earlier versions.
