You can see it in the passcode settings on iOS devices where the setting for USB Accessories is by default off. After one hour, iOS blocks USB accessories connecting to the deviceÂ through cable adapters to the phoneÂs Lightning port.Will this effectively shut out tools like Cellebrite and If the companies and their government customers are unable to crack the new iOS feature, it may trigger a return to the security standoff thatÂ included the moment in 2016Â when then-presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested boycotting Apple if it didnÂt write code to let police access suspectsÂ devices.Dave Maynor, who works on the threat intelligence team at Talos,Â Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
