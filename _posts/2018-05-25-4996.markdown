Statistics gathered from over 11 million enterprise users reveal that Windows 10 market share is growing, Windows 7 has been slowly phased out, and, unfortunately, a large number of users are still using outdated operating systems.This statistical data was gathered by Duo Security, a cyber-security firm, and provider of secure login/access solutions, and compiled in the company's yearly Trusted Access Report.According to Duo, more and more of enterprise users using its solutions are working from remote locations. But this wasn't a surprise for the company, being already known from other reports [What did surprise Duo experts was the sudden decline in Windows 7 usage from 2017 to 2018. Usage dropped from 65% of all Windows users in 2017 to only 27% in 2018 (see chart above).Experts believe that the WannaCry ransomware incident had an effect on enterprises abandoning Windows 7, mainly because But Duo stats also showed that not all users switching from Windows 7 migrated to Windows 10.
