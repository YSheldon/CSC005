This makes it obvious that it aims to download the Owari bot, another Mirai variant, instead of the previously hinted at Sora bot,” explained “However, at the time of analysis, the Owari bot samples could no longer be found in the website directory. In another turn of events, it turns out that they have been replaced by the samples shown below, which were later found to be the Omni bot.”In fact, it is believed that the same author, who used the pseudonym “Wicked” in an interview last April is responsible for Owari, Sora, Omni and Wicked.“This also leads us to the conclusion that while the Wicked bot was originally meant to deliver the Sora botnet, it was later repurposed to serve the author’s succeeding projects,” the researchers argued.
