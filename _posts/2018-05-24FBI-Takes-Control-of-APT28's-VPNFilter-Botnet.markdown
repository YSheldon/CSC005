美国联邦调查局（FBI）已获得法院命令，并控制了500000多个设备的大型僵尸网络的命令和控制服务器，称为VPN过滤器僵尸网络。K在乌克兰上，僵尸网络的运营商正努力在国内尽可能多地感染设备。乌克兰秘密服务局证实，僵尸网络是由一个著名的俄罗斯网络间谍单位控制的。APT28、SEDNIT、奇幻熊、典当风暴、软弱无力、灰熊草原、锶、Tsar Team等。这一组在过去曾针对乌克兰的几起网络攻击，如安全专家认为VPFET-僵尸网络极其危险，这不仅是因为它是一个国家STA的工作。TE网络集团有着不正当的原因，但因为它还包括拦截网络流量、搜索SCADA设备和擦除固件以临时砖块设备的功能。如此强大的能力，以及全世界受到感染的设备，美国当局介入进来。这一威胁进一步受到损害。在思科报告发布后的几小时，联邦调查局获得了一份牢牢掌握的域名，联邦调查局现在要求世界各地的用户拥有受影响的路由器和NAS设备来重置他们的设备。这些设备重新连接到命令和控制服务器，使FBI充分了解僵尸网络的真实大小。FBI计划利用这些知识来创建脆弱设备的列表，并通知ISP、私人和公共部门合作伙伴可以处理受感染的设备。以下类型的设备易受VPNFLASH恶意软件攻击，并应根据FBI的建议重新启动设备：
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has obtained court orders and has taken control of the command and control servers of a massive botnet of over 500,000 devices, known as the VPNFilter botnet.The existence of this massive threat Cisco said the botnet appeared to be preparing for an attack on Ukraine, as the botnet's operators were working hard to infect as many devices as possible within the country.The Ukrainian Secret Service The FBI confirmed that the botnet has been created and was under the control of a famous Russian cyber-espionage unit known under different names, such as APT28, Sednit, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Grizzly Steppe, STRONTIUM, Tsar Team, and others.A This group has been behind several cyber-attacks aimed at Ukraine in the past, such as Security experts deemed the VPFilter botnet incredibly dangerous, not only because it was the work of a nation-state cyber group with nefarious reasons, but because it also included functions to intercept network traffic, search for SCADA equipment, and wipe firmware to temporarily brick devices.With such powerful capabilities, and with devices infected all over the world, US authorities stepped in to prevent further damage from this threat.Hours after the publication of the Cisco report, the FBI had obtained a With the domain firmly in its grasp, the FBI is now asking users across the world who own affected routers and NAS devices to reset their equipment.The reasoning, according to the FBI, is to make these devices reconnect to the command and control server, giving the FBI a full insight into the botnet's real size.The FBI plans to use this knowledge to create a list of vulnerable devices and notify ISPs, private and public sector partners that can deal with the infected devices.Owners of the following types of devices are vulnerable to the VPNFilter malware, and should reboot their devices, based on the FBI's advice:
