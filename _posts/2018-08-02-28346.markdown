The FBI has arrested the alleged three leaders of an international crime syndicate that stole huge numbers of credit card numbers  which were subsequently sold on and used to rack up tens of millions of dollars in spending sprees.Speaking in Seattle, USA, where the Feds' cybersecurity taskforce is based, agents said the "Fin7" group was responsible for The group is alleged to have used phishing attacks, sending emails with attachments that launched a customized form of the Once the software nasty was opened and installed, it would seek out credit card details and customers' personal information from payment systems, and siphon them off to the Fin7 gang  which then sold the sensitive data on online marketplaces to crooks to exploit. Infosec biz FireEye has The first suspected Fin7 kingpin was arrested back in January in Germany, the authorities said, but that indictment was kept under seal while the FBI continued its investigations. The unnamed individual has since been extradited to the US and will appear in court in Seattle in May.The subsequent investigation then led to two further arrests: one in Poland and another in Spain. Both are currently in the middle of extradition hearings.

"We have made clear to folks that when they travel abroad and think they are safe, they are not. We are going to find these people and hold them to account.

Asked about the sentences that the three individuals face, Hayes noted that it would depends on individual circumstances but that they were looking at "very long sentences" stretching to "decades."In terms of limiting cybercrime, both law enforcement and credit card representatives made the same recommendations: keep an eye on all your credit card transactions, report any suspicious ones to your credit card company, and do not open suspicious or unexpected downloads and email attachments.
