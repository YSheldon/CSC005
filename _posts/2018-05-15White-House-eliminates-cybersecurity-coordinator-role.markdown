(Image: file photo)The Trump administration no longer has a cybersecurity coordinator.The job, seen as the most senior cybersecurity role in the government, was eliminated Tuesday by White House national security advisor John Bolton. The position was designed to help coordinate efforts across government, but it had come under fire in recent weeks Geller The role was seen as vitally important by many -- including Congress -- following Mark Warner, a Democratic senator and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted shortly before the news was announced that the government "should be investing in our nation's cyber defense, not rolling it back." "We also need to articulate a clear cyber doctrine. I don't see how getting rid of the top cyber official in the White House does anything to make our country safer from cyber threats," he said.The White House's own economic policy advisors estimate that cyberattacks and malicious cyber activities cost the US economy as much as $109 billion in 2016 alone.A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.Zack Whittaker can be reached securely on Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755–8849, and his PGP fingerprint for email is: 4D0E 92F2 E36A EC51 DAAE 5D97 CB8C 15FA EB6C EEA5.
