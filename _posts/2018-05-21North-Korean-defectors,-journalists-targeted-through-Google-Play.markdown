TTTA新设计旨在揭露和攻击朝鲜叛逃者利用谷歌游戏已被揭露。TTTA组被称为“Sun团队”被认为是在最新的尝试间谍的背后。See为“BloodAssistant”，一个医疗服务，“为朝鲜祈祷”。Twitin新的活动，Sun Team——基于电子邮件帐户和与先前攻击相关的Android设备命名——已经开发出了三个装载MalCug的新的移动应用程序。“Gedidies信息”和提供食物项目的数据，而另外两个“快速Apple”和“Apple OkFlash”伪装成与安全相关的软件。TTFAST APPLOK和ApLoCKFELE连接到云服务器来接收命令，包括下载有效载荷，如可执行文件（.DEX）文件。这些应用程序还能够窃取与设备相关的数据。TTMcAfee认为Apple OkFoice，尤其是侦察阶段的一部分，特别是当应用程序试图吸引用户进一步在社交媒体上传播时，比如脸谱网联系人和朋友。通过恶意应用程序，嵌入式恶意软件然后使用Dropbox和YANDEX上传信息和发布命令——与过去使用的威胁处理器相同的技术。TTE研究人员从这些云存储站点中发现了信息日志，这些信息暗示了同样的测试Android D。EVICES也被用来开发这些恶意APP.TTAndroid设备用于测试恶意软件的功能已经在不同的国家制造。然而，他们都携带了安装的韩国应用程序，并使用了公开可用的沙箱逃逸、特权升级和代码执行漏洞的修改版本，这些漏洞对Read Digy特洛伊木马附加了额外的功能。TT“修改后的漏洞表明攻击者并不熟练。H发现零天，写自己的功绩，“研究人员说。然而，TTAN对威胁组的操作进行了广泛的调查，发现了恶意软件的不同版本，这些恶意软件在2017年似乎已经活跃起来。恶意软件的开发者与Sun团队相关的早期地址是相同的。TTI恶意应用指向朝鲜IP地址，但试图通过在全国流行的名人名字命名系统来出现韩国。然而，韩语词汇的尴尬使用表明，虽然操作者熟悉韩国的文化，但他们不是本地人。RedDawn竞选活动的许多要素与一月采用的技术相同。然而，McAfee也发现了一种新的令人不安的趋势——使用偷来的照片。从社交网络拍摄的图像正在被用来创建个人的、伪造的韩国账户来传播MalCube。TTT也有证据表明，那些拍过照片的人也有他们的身份被偷走了。基于这些被盗配置文件的文本和呼叫服务正在被用于注册韩国在线服务，这可能会进一步传播恶意软件。TT“这些元素是暗示，但不是确认，这些恶意软件运动背后的行动者的国籍，”McAfee AdD.TT。这些应用程序被上传到谷歌游戏作为“未发布”版本。继网络安全公司的报告之后，移动应用程序只能在被删除之前感染大约100个设备。
tttA new campaign designed to uncover and attack defectors from North Korea by exploiting Google Play has been uncovered.ttttA group called "Sun Team" is believed to be behind the latest attempt to spy on defectors.ttThe threat actors ttThe malicious applications used in the past wave of attacks posed as "BloodAssistant," a healthcare service, and "Pray for North Korea."ttIn the new campaign, Sun Team -- so named based on email accounts and Android devices connected to previous attacks -- has developed three new mobile apps laden with malware.ttThe first application is translated as "Food Ingredients Info" and offers data on food items, while the other two, "Fast AppLock" and "AppLockFree," masquerade as security-related software.ttFast AppLock and AppLockFree connect to a cloud server to receive commands, including the download of payloads such as executable (.dex) files. The apps are also able to steal device-related data.ttMcAfee believes that AppLockFree, in particular, is part of a reconnaissance stage, especially as the app then attempts to lure the user to spread it further on social media, such as to Facebook contacts and friends.ttOnce a victim's device is infected with a malicious application, embedded malware then uses Dropbox and Yandex to upload information and issue commands -- the same technique used in the past by the threat actors.ttThe researchers uncovered information logs from these cloud storage sites which suggests the same test Android devices are also being used to develop these malicious apps.ttAndroid devices used to test the malware's functionality have been manufactured in different countries. However, all of them carry installed Korean apps and use modified versions of publicly available sandbox escape, privilege escalation, and code execution exploits which bolt-on additional functionality to the RedDawn Trojans.tt"The modified exploits suggest that the attackers are not skillful enough to find zero-days and write their own exploits," the researchers say. "However, it is likely just a matter of time before they start to exploit vulnerabilities."ttAn extensive investigation into the threat group's operations uncovered different versions of the malware, which appears to have become active back in 2017.ttFurthermore, the email addresses used by the new malware's developers are identical to earlier addresses associated with Sun Team.ttThe malicious apps point to North Korean IP addresses but attempt to appear South Korean by naming systems based on popular celebrity names in the country. However, the awkward use of South Korean vocabulary suggests that while the operators are familiar with South Korea's culture, they are not native speakers.ttMany elements of the RedDawn campaign are the same as the techniques employed in January. However, McAfee has also discovered a new and disturbing trend -- the use of stolen pictures. Images taken from social networks are being used to create individual, fake South Korean accounts to spread the malware.tttThere is also evidence that some of those who have had their pictures taken have also had their entire identities stolen. Text and calling services based on these stolen profiles are being used to sign up for South Korean online services, which may further propagate the malware.tt"These elements are suggestive, though not a confirmation, of the nationality of the actors behind these malware campaigns," McAfee added.ttThe apps were uploaded to Google Play as "unreleased" versions. Following the cybersecurity firm's report, the mobile applications were only able to infect approximately 100 devices before being removed.
