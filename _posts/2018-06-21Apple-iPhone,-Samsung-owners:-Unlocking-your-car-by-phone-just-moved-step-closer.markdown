正在制定一个新的规范，目的是让车主解锁和锁定他们的车辆使用智能手机。汽车连通联盟（CCC）将苹果和三星作为成员，发布了CCC正在寻求使用现有技术，如蓝牙和NFC作为数字密钥标准的一部分。该规范概述了多个用例，例如智能手机将如何解锁或锁定车辆，例如，当它靠近时，通过将其放置在传感器附近，或通过打开应用程序。为了使用密钥，规范建议认证可能需要通过密码或电话的生物特征读取器。该规范还讨论了关键的供应和撤销，指出潜在的应用汽车共享业务和汽车租赁机构，这将能够给客户一个数字键在他们的电话，到期后租赁期完成。这种机制不知道汽车或智能设备的品牌，所以租赁代理是客户的单一联系点。这项技术在购买二手车时也会派上用场，该系统允许新主人简单地撤销所有以前提供的钥匙。该规范没有详细说明密钥是如何被保护的，但它确实说明了它使用的任何机制都需要防止未经授权的复制、修改和删除现有密钥。它还需要防止未授权的配置，以及在软件攻击者、物理攻击和对设备和车辆之间的通信的攻击中的因素。据推测，汽车的数字钥匙将面临类似于当今各种智能锁的安全挑战，如CCC所见，数字钥匙项目正在使用“汽车制造商和手机供应商的专长，有助于开发整个数字钥匙生态系统，而AddiSsii则有助于开发整个数字钥匙生态系统。在Q1 2019中发布的数字密钥发布2将概述车辆和智能设备之间的标准认证协议。CCC的董事会包括通用汽车公司、大众、戴姆勒、RealVNC、HTC、PSA、本田、LG电子、现代、阿尔卑斯、丰田、松下和三星的代表。CCC的特许成员公司包括苹果、奥迪、宝马、通用汽车、现代、LG电子、松下、三星和大众。核心成员包括阿尔卑斯电气、大陆汽车、电装、GEMALTO、NXP和高通公司，作为奥迪“通过标准化符合我们安全标准的数字密钥解决方案，我们在广泛的基础上为创新服务奠定了基础”，Ulf Warschat说。BMW也热衷于发行2。“利用发布2的所有好处，将使一个可扩展的解决方案，与所有智能设备和车辆提供一个卓越的用户体验给我们的客户互操作，”宝马AG公司的Alexander Maier说。一些大众和奥迪模型易受Wi-Fi和蜂窝网络的远程黑客攻击。高调黑客们导致许多人质疑当今汽车日益增长的连通性。风险是真实的，但现在的反应比行动更重要。为什么你可以买一个成品的Android汽车头单元，当你可以用树莓PI 3破解一个？车辆黑客可以通过冒充电子部件来禁用大多数现代汽车的安全特性。
A new specification is being developed with the aim of letting car owners unlock and lock their vehicles using a smartphone. The Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC), which counts Apple and Samsung as members, has published the CCC is looking to use existing technologies such as Bluetooth and NFC as part of the Digital Key standard. The specification outlines a number of use cases, such as how a smartphone would unlock or lock the vehicle, for example, when it is in close proximity, by placing it near a sensor, or by opening an app. To use the key, the specification suggests authentication could be required either via passcodes or a phone's biometric readers. The specification also discusses key provisioning and revocation, pointing to potential applications for car-sharing businesses and car-rental agencies, which would be able to give customers a Digital Key on their phone that expires after the rental period is completed. "This mechanism works agnostic of the brand of the car or the smart device, so that the rental agency is the single contact point for the customer," it notes. This technology could also come in handy when buying a secondhand car, with the system allowing the new owner to simply revoke all previously provisioned keys. The specification doesn't go into specifics about how the keys will need to be protected, but it does say whatever mechanism it uses it will need to prevent unauthorized copying, modification and deletion of existing keys. It will also need to prevent unauthorized provisioning, and factor in software attackers, physical attacks, and attacks on communications between the device and vehicle. Presumably, Digital Keys for the car will face similar security challenges to today's various smart locks, as seen in According to CCC, the Digital Key project is using "the expertise of the automakers and handset vendors contributing to development of an entire Digital Key ecosystem while addressing the concerns of reliability and security".Digital Key Release 2.0, scheduled for release in Q1 2019, will outline a standardized authentication protocol between the vehicle and smart device. CCC's board includes representatives from General Motors, Volkswagen, Daimler, RealVNC, HTC, PSA, Honda, LG Electronics, Hyundai, Alpine, Toyota, Panasonic, and Samsung. CCC's charter member companies include Apple, Audi, BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Samsung, and Volkswagen. Core members include Alps Electric, Continental Automotive, Denso, Gemalto, NXP, and Qualcomm.As Audi "By standardizing a Digital Key solution that complies with our security standards we lay the building blocks for innovative services on a broad basis,"said Ulf Warschat, head of Body Electronics at Audi.BMW is also keen on Release 2.0. "Leveraging all benefits of Release 2.0 will enable a scalable solution, interoperable with all smart devices and vehicles delivering a superior user experience to our customers," said Alexander Maier, BMW AG. Some VW and Audi models are vulnerable to remote hacking over Wi-Fi and cellular networks.High-profile hacks have led many to question the growing connectedness of today's automobiles. The risks are real, but the response is currently more talk than action.Why buy a finished Android Auto head unit when you can hack one together with a Raspberry Pi 3?A vehicle hack can disable safety features on most modern cars by posing as a faulty electronic component.
