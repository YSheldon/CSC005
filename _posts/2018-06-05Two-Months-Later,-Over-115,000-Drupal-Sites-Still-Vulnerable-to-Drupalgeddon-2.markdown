两个月后，Drupal项目发布了一个非常严重的安全漏洞补丁，有超过115000个Drupal网站未能安装修复，现在正处于网络罪犯的摆布。这个估计来自美国安全研究人员Troy Mursch，他花了最后的FE。W天扫描互联网上运行Drupal 7 .x CMS版本的所有网站。MursCH能够找到超过500000个网站，他说他能够识别115070个运行过时Drupal 7的网站。XCMS版本易受CVE-2018－7600的影响，也被称为CVE-2018－7600。安全漏洞在2018年3月下旬曝光，被认为是影响Drupal CMS最严重的安全漏洞之一，因为最初的DrupalDeDon缺陷在2014被发现。该漏洞允许攻击者通过访问一个畸形的URL来接管一个站点，而不是认证。需要。Drupal 6、x、7 x和8 x版本都有补丁。Mursch的扫描没有找到6。x和8。x的站点，但是他识别和扫描的500000个站点被认为是今天部署的所有Drupal站点的一半。黑客开始利用DrupalDeDon 2漏洞。仅仅两个星期后补丁出现了，因为大多数黑客不知道如何攻击漏洞。剥削尝试很快就开始了，这个漏洞已经被用来感染服务器，在一个研究者发表了115000的Drupal 7。X网站仍然没有DrupalDeDon 2补丁，这些活动有大量的炮灰在他们的处置。
Two months after the Drupal project released a patch for a highly critical security flaw, there are over 115,000 Drupal sites that have failed to install the fix and are now at the mercy of cyber-criminals.This estimation comes from Troy Mursch, a US-based security researcher, who spent the last few days scanning the Internet for all sites running a version of the Drupal 7.x CMS.Mursch was able to find over 500,000 of these sites, and he says that he was able to identify 115,070 websites running an outdated Drupal 7.x CMS version, vulnerable to CVE-2018-7600, also known as CVE-2018-7600 is a security flaw that came to light in late March 2018 and was considered one of the most severe security flaws to affect the Drupal CMS since the original Drupalgeddon flaw discovered back in 2014.The vulnerability allows attackers to take over a site just by accessing a malformed URL, no authentication required. Patches were made available for Drupal 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x versions.Mursch's scan didn't look for 6.x and 8.x sites, but the 500,000 sites he managed to identify and scan are believed to be half of all the Drupal sites deployed online today.Hackers started exploiting the Drupalgeddon 2 vulnerability only two weeks after patches came out because most hackers didn't know how to attack the flaw. Exploitation attempts began soon Since then, the flaw has been used to infect servers with In a The researcher published a With 115,000 of Drupal 7.x sites still without the Drupalgeddon 2 patch, these campaigns have loads of cannon fodder at their disposal.
