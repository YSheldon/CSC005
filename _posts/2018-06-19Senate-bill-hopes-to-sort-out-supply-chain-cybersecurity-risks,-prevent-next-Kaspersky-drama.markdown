A new bipartisan Senate bill would try to get to the bottom of supply chain risks by setting up a new federal acquisition council that would include representation from the intelligence community and Defense Department.The goal of the bill is to help streamline coordination between agencies so that the government can avoid buying technology that’s bugged by foreign spies.The “Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act” was introduced Tuesday by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. It tasks agencies across the government with creating a strategy to tackle supply chain threats embedded in federally procured technology systems. If a malicious piece of equipment enters the supply chain of government agencies, experts say it could be used for espionage or more destructive purposes.The announcement comes after a year in which top officials have repeatedly grappled with national security concerns surrounding Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, an anti-virus software maker that until recently had been selling products to federal agencies. Lawmakers ambiguously claim that Kaspersky could be coopted by Russian intelligence to spy on specific users. But the company has consistently denied all wrongdoing.In practice, the bill intends to bridge “the information gap between the intelligence community, the Department of Defense, and the rest of the government on technology vulnerabilities and characteristics that could jeopardize our national security,” the senators’ offices said in a prepared statement. An Office of Management and Budget official would chair the inter-agency council, which would issue guidance on IT threats.The bill represents the latest attempt to legislate on the supply-chain challenge after the Senate passed a defense bill Monday with a provision that would U.S. intelligence officials widely accuse Kaspersky, ZTE, and another Chinese company, Huawei, of enabling espionage through the companies’ alleged ties to Moscow and Beijing.With acquisition policy emanating from multiple agencies, Lankford and McCaskill say more clarity is necessary.“We can’t simply respond to supply chain threats piecemeal, we’ve got to have a system in place to assess these risks across the government, and that’s what this bipartisan bill does,” McCaskill said in a statement.Under the bill, the council would decide whether one agency’s ban on a company’s products should apply to other agencies. The Department of Homeland Security has exercised authority over civilian agencies on this issue, as it did last year when it
