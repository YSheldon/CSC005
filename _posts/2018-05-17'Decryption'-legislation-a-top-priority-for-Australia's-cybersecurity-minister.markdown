执法和网络安全部长安古斯泰勒星期四在悉尼的CEBIT澳大利亚会议上表示，联邦政府推动加密通信的努力是他最优先考虑的事项之一，但他拒绝提供立法预期的日期。联合国总理马尔科姆·特恩布尔和他的质疑，如果拟议的立法在技术上是可行的，ZDNET问首相是否“澳大利亚的法律在澳大利亚占主导地位，我可以向你保证，”特恩布尔告诉ZDNET。数学定律是非常值得称道的，但在澳大利亚适用的唯一法律是澳大利亚的法律。“在他的媒体宣传中，特恩布尔确信他让澳大利亚知道他的意图是保护国家免遭恐怖主义和犯罪圈，比如那些参与恋童癖的人。泰勒在星期四没有提供进一步细节的情况下，不同意法律的技术规范，但他说，联盟仍打算出台一项强制公司屈服于政府意愿的法案。ETS积极使用加密消息传递…“90%的数据被联邦警察合法拦截，使用某种形式的加密，”部长说。泰勒说，澳大利亚机构预测，到2020，大多数通信将是端到端加密的。“让我清楚这一点，我们支持对信息安全的强加密。RMITE和隐私保护。“我们坚信通过加密，网络安全将得到加强——这是一件好事，”泰勒继续说，“但是在未来几年中，它的无处不在的使用对执法产生了非常严重的威胁，澳大利亚公众有权期望在澳大利亚运营的公司将成为ASE。泰勒说：“他们可以——在合理的范围内——这是重要的限定词，有合法的请求来获取数据。”特恩布尔说，特恩布尔在七月宣布的立法工作是“我的首要任务之一”。立法的临近日期。这是一个世界性的大问题，我在世界各地的机构发表演讲。我们认为加密对于网络安全至关重要。“削弱加密作为支持执法的手段，这不是我们想要的……我也认为我们可以在不打破加密的情况下支持执法。“7个月后，总理马尔科姆·特恩布尔告诉ZDNET澳大利亚的法律将超越数学定律，”内政部长Peter Dutton讨论了即将出台的强制公司立法。帮助政府进行沟通。TrSA的全球公共部门实践副总裁Mike Brown和通用汽车公司相信，有一种更好的方法来阻止恐怖主义，而不是打破端到端加密，正如澳大利亚政府最近提出的那样。据国防部执法和网络安全部部长安古斯泰勒说，理解网络安全的严重性的TA总理与跨政府和公私信息共享倡议相结合，已经将澳大利亚推向了前列。该中心的主席呼吁建立一个全面的能力，支持联邦、州和基于领土的网络犯罪，努力将当前的能力标注为“相对薄弱”。
Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Angus Taylor has told the CeBIT Australia conference in Sydney on Thursday that the federal government's push to access encrypted communication is one of his highest priorities, but he refused to offer a date of when legislation can be expected.Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, along with his Questioning if the proposed legislation was technically possible, ZDNet asked the prime minister if the "The laws of Australia prevail in Australia, I can assure you of that," Turnbull told ZDNet. "The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia."During his media rounds, Turnbull made sure he let Australia know his intention was to protect the nation from terrorism and criminal rings such as those involved in paedophilia, rather than nutting out the technical specs of the laws While no further detail was offered on Thursday, Taylor said the Coalition still intends to introduce legislation that would force companies to bend to the government's will.Pointing to the "95 percent of ASIOs most concerning counter-terrorism targets actively use encrypted messaging ... and 90 percent of data lawfully intercepted by the federal police use some form of encryption," the minister said.Taylor said Australian agencies predict that by 2020, most communications will be end-to-end encrypted."Let me be clear about this, we support strong encryption for the security of information and the protection of privacy. We firmly believe that cybersecurity will be enhanced by encryption -- it is a good thing," Taylor continued."But its near-ubiquitous use in the coming years poses a very serious threat for law enforcement and the Australian public have the right to expect a company operating in Australia will assist where they can -- within reason -- and that being the important qualifier, with lawful requests to access for data."Taylor said progressing the work on legislation that Turnbull announced in July is "one of my highest priorities"."The focus is on getting it right, not rushing it," Taylor said of the looming date of the legislation. "This is a big issue across the world, I'm speaking with agencies across the world ... we see encryption as crucial for cybersecurity."To weaken encryption as a means for supporting law enforcement that's not what we want ... I also think we can support law enforcement without breaking encryption." t tSeven months after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told ZDNet the laws of Australia will trump the laws of mathematics, Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton has discussed looming legislation that would force companies to help the government access communications. t tRSA's VP and GM of Global Public Sector Practice Mike Brown believes there's a better way to thwart terrorism than breaking end-to-end encryption, as recently proposed by the Australian government. t tA prime minister that understands the seriousness of cybersecurity combined with cross-government and public-private information sharing initiatives has sent Australia to the fore, according to Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Angus Taylor. t tThe centre's chair has called for an overarching capability that supports federal, state, and territory-based cybercrime-countering efforts, labelling current capacities 'relatively weak'.
