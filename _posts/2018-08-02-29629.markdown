Kontron, which is owned by parent company ST, isnt yet saying how much it paid for Inocybe until the public company ST informs its shareholders.Kontrons SymKloud platform supports the deployment of virtualized services using SDN and The company competes against the likes of hardware original equipment manufacturers such as Super Micro as well as We are strong in compute solutions and Inocybe has been heavily involved as a contributor to the OpenDaylight (ODL) The difference is that Lumina has a business model around selling services, taking what exists and making it fit your application, said Courteau. Inocybe is more of a product model, and its contribution to ODL is more product-based.Inocybe also competes in the same ecosystem as companies involved with the I have no problem if someone wants a Dell switch with Inocybe open source software or uses our hardware or software as long as they can solve their problem, he said.In addition to Inocybes SDN controller technology, Kontron also picks up a new customer group  enterprises. And it gets Inocybes software delivery platform.Courteau said the software delivery platform really manages your ingredient list. And in terms of enterprise customers, he said, Inocybe has a track in the enterprise business where we have zero presence. We have a nice overlap in the traditional OEM side and some overlaps on the operators side.Inocybes General Manager John Zannos has been named GM of Kontrons Inocybe business. And Mathieu Lemay, the founder of Inocybe, becomes chief strategy officer of the Inocybe business at Kontron. The integration is made easier by the fact that both Kontron and Inocybe are based in Montreal, Canada.Linda Hardesty is Managing Editor at SDxCentral where she oversees the news coverage for a team of writers.
