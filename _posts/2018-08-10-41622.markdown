A honeypot project operated by Japanese comms company NTT has turned up a bunch of new approaches to malware obfuscation.Yuta Takata of NTT's Secure Platform Laboratories has published an analysis at the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC) Takata's group identified five evasion techniques that all abuse differences between JavaScript implementations, he stated, which is more complex than familiar redirection attacks that look at the In other words, this code would redirect an Internet Explorer 8 user to an attack site, but leave others alone:It matters, Takata said, because the evasion techniques identified in the research can serve as attack signatures.The NTT team took two approaches to traffic collection: a "high interaction" honeyclient (a real browser designed to detect browser exploits), and a "low interaction" honeyclient that can "emulate many different client profiles, trace complicated redirections and hook code executions in detail".Over several years, the NTT group collected and analysed 8,500 JavaScript samples from 20,000-plus malicious sites, and found five previously unseen evasion techniques as shown below.Takata wrote that of these That particular function helped attackers identify IE 8 and IE 9 browsers, because they return an "Invalid argument" error if a site asks them to process That code turned out to be the strongest IOC of the five evasive code snippets NTT identified in its scan of more than 860,000 URLs: all of the 26 URLs that served up
