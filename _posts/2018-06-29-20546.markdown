This seemed unusual, as overall only 0.8% of all our customers had used Ticketmaster.She claimed that over the next few days more fraudulent transactions were attempted on cards which had previously been used at Ticketmaster.It notified the ticketing giant on April 12 but the fraud attempts kept on coming and eventually Monzo was forced to ask Mastercard directly to proactively replace every one of its customers cards that had been used at Ticketmaster, so confident was the firm that a breach had taken place.Throughout this period we were in direct contact with Ticketmaster, On Thursday 19th April, they told us an internal investigation had found no evidence of a breach and that no other banks were reporting similar patterns.Ticketmaster finally revealed a breach had indeed taken place at the firm, affecting less than 5% of its global customer base, Even more bad news for the ticketing giant came from Inbenta Technologies, the third-party supplier who hosted the customer support product where the malware was found.It explained in a new note that the source of the breach was a single piece of JavaScript code customized by Inbenta for Ticketmaster, but implemented by the ticket firm in an insecure manner.After a careful analysis of all clues and snapshots from our systems, the technical team at Inbenta discovered that the script had been implemented on the payment page, the firm Allen Scott, consumer EMEA director at Monzos quick identification of, and response to, the Ticketmaster data breach is a great example that every financial institution and online service should look to mirror, he added.Like so many businesses who fall victim to data breaches, Ticketmaster has been slow to respond and put right this wrong. To win the battle against online fraud, we need businesses to join forces and support one another in identifying and responding to security threats.It remains to be seen whether the firm will be investigated under the new GDPR, given that the initial incident now appears to have happened before May 25, although there are strict rules around 72-hour breach disclosure.
