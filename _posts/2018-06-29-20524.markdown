Security firm FireEye has detected that malware authors have deployed the PROPagate code injection technique for the first time inside a live malware distribution campaign.The infosec research community deemed the technique innovative, similar in creativity to the AtomBombing technique, albeit both different in their own right.But while it took malware authors four months to weaponize AtomBombing and use it in active malware campaigns, PROPagate proved to be a little harder to integrate, as its first appearance came in the double the time.In a According to FireEye, the operators of the RIG exploit kit have launched a recent campaign that hijacks traffic from legitimate sites using a hidden iframe and redirects them to a so-called "landing page."On this page, the RIG exploit kit uses one of three techniques via malicious JavaScript, Flash, or Visual Basic script to download and run a malicious NSIS installer.The installer triggers a three-stage mechanism that incorporates the PROPagate technique to infect the user with the final payload a Monero cryptocurrency miner.According to FireEye, the NSIS installer "leverages the PROPagate injection technique to inject shellcode into explorer.exe," hiding malicious code into a benign looking process.Bleeping Computer has previously explained in a previous article regarding the effectiveness of exploit kits that
