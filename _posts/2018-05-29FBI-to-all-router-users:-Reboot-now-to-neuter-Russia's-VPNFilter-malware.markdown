联邦调查局敦促小企业和家庭立即重新启动路由器，思科的报告称，500000个受感染的设备可以用一个命令销毁。恶意软件，TISCO的TalOS智能研究者恶意软件能够收集通过受感染路由器发送的流量，如网站凭证。然而，最令人担忧的是恶意软件允许其控制器擦除受感染设备的固件的一部分，使其无用。攻击者可以有选择地摧毁单个设备，或者一次性清除所有受感染的设备。TCISCO星期三发布了该报告，该报告在本月观察到乌克兰感染的高峰期，该国还将俄罗斯归咎于去年六月的NoPETYA袭击，这些袭击主要影响乌克兰组织，但也蔓延到在乌克兰设有办事处的跨国公司。受感染路由器的用户可以通过重新启动设备来移除VPNFLASE的危险级2和第3级组件。然而，VPNFLASH的第1阶段将在重启后继续存在，可能允许攻击者重新感染受损路由器。FBI星期三抓获的网络地址“No.ALL”可能已经被用来重新安装第2阶段和第3阶段恶意软件，但是现在所有地址的流量都被引导到FBI控制下的服务器。尽管如此，FBI仍敦促所有小型办公室和家庭路由器所有者重新启动设备，即使它们不是由受影响的供应商制造的。这将有助于中性化威胁并帮助FBI识别受感染的设备。FBI建议小型办公室和家庭办公室路由器的所有人重新启动设备，以暂时破坏恶意软件，并帮助潜在的识别受感染的设备，”联邦调查局在一份公共服务声明中说。“所有者”建议考虑禁用设备上的远程管理设置，并在启用时使用强密码和加密进行安全保护。网络设备应该升级到最新可用的固件版本。”司法部说，受感染的设备正在与之通信的联邦调查局控制的服务器将收集每个设备的IP地址。这些地址与非盈利网络安全组织SimoServer基金会共享，后者将向外国证书和ISP传播地址。联邦调查局和美国国土安全部证书也通知了一些ISP。TIT还不知道攻击者最初是如何感染路由器的，但是SyMtTeTeNe:大多数针对目标的设备都知道使用默认凭据和/或已知的漏洞，特别是对于旧版本。目前没有迹象表明，零日漏洞的利用涉及到传播威胁，“赛门铁克研究人员写道。已知的受感染设备包括：思科公司的TalOS已经发布了VPNFLAST恶意软件的初步发现，该恶意软件主要针对来自一系列供应商的消费者互联网路由器，一些消费者NAS设备也受到攻击。信息安全事件“通过网络钓鱼邮件传递有效载荷，但是在目标滚动到第三页之前什么都没有发生……
 tThe FBI is urging small businesses and households to immediately reboot routers following Cisco's report that 500,000 infected devices could be destroyed with a single command. tThe malware,tCisco's Talos Intelligence researcherstThe malware is capable of collecting traffic sent through infected routers, such as website credentials. tHowever, the most worrying capability is that malware allows its controllers to wipe a portion of an infected device's firmware, rendering it useless. The attackers can selectively destroy a single device or wipe all infected devices at once. tCisco released the report on Wednesday after observing a spike this month in infections in the Ukraine, whichtThe country also blamed Russia for last June's NotPetya attacks that mostly affected Ukraine organizations but also spread within multinational corporations with offices in Ukraine. tUsers with infected routers can remove the dangerous Stage 2 and Stage 3 components of VPNFilter by rebooting the device. However, Stage 1 of VPNFilter will persist after a reboot, potentially allowing the attackers to reinfect the compromised routers. tThe web address the FBI seized on Wednesday, ToKnowAll[.]com, could have been used to reinstall Stage 2 and Stage 3 malware, but all traffic to this address is now being directed to a server under the FBI's control. tThe FBI nonetheless is urging all small office and home router owners to reboot devices even if they were not made by one of the affected vendors.This will help neuter the threat and help the FBI identify infected devices. t"The FBI recommends any owner of small office and home office routers reboot the devices to temporarily disrupt the malware and aid the potential identification of infected devices," the FBI said in a public-service announcement. t"Owners are advised to consider disabling remote-management settings on devices and secure with strong passwords and encryption when enabled. Network devices should be upgraded to the latest available versions of firmware." t tThe Justice Department said the FBI-controlled server to which infected devices are now communicating with will collect the IP addresses of each device. The addresses are being shared with the non-profit cyber security group, The Shadowserver Foundation, which will disseminate the addresses to foreign CERTs and ISPs. The FBI and US DHS CERT has also notified some ISPs. tIt's not known how the attackers initially infected the routers, but Symantect"Most of the devices targeted are known to use default credentials and/or have known exploits, particularly for older versions. There is no indication at present that the exploit of zero-day vulnerabilities is involved in spreading the threat," wrote Symantec researchers. tKnown infected devices include:Cisco's Talos has published preliminary findings of the VPNFilter malware, which is targeting mostly consumer internet routers from a range of vendors, with some consumer NAS devices also hit.German intelligence services and federal specialists are investigating "an IT security incident".The payload is delivered via phishing emails about a real defence conference -- but nothing happens until the target scrolls down to the third page...
