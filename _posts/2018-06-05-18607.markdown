A new widespread vulnerability that lets an attacker execute remoteÂ commands affects web development tools offered by Amazon Web Services, HP, and other companies, according to secure-coding startup Snyk.The so-called ÂZip SlipÂ vulnerability, which is particularly prevalent in JavaScript, Âaffects thousands of projectsÂ supported by those internet giants plus other companies, Snyk co-founder Danny Grander said in an Â[T]his type of vulnerability has existed before, but recently it has manifested itself in a much larger number of projects and libraries,Â Grander wrote.The vulnerability allows an attacker to Âgain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside,Â according to Snyk, potentially letting the adversary overwrite configuration files. To do that, an attacker needs both a Âa malicious archive and extraction code that does not perform validation checking,Â the firm said.Snyk said that it began privately disclosing the vulnerability to affected coding libraries on April 15, and thatÂ Amazon, HP and others have since released patches.ÂGiven the severity and widespread nature of the Zip Slip vulnerability, I very strongly recommend you spend some time ensuring you are not vulnerable either through other libraries or your own code,Â Grander wrote.Snyk included a video demonstrating the exploit in GranderÂs blog post:
