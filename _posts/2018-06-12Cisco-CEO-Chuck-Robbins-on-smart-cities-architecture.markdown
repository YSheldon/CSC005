虽然智能城市解决方案的交付需要一个总体规划，但它们往往最终被一个项目一次部署，而专注于更大的图片实际上已经减缓了思科在其智能城市推压之前，首席执行官Chuck Robbins告诉ZDNet：“我想它就像其他C一样。“复杂的技术架构；我认为你应该知道最终状态是什么样子的，但现实是，如果你打算从那里开始，你将永远不会做任何事情，”罗宾斯在奥兰多思科2018号现场对ZDNET说。“我认为这是我们多年来遇到的问题之一。”他说，“智能城市的部署最终取决于一个城市最需要的用例，比如智能停车、交通管理、智能照明和废物管理。”罗宾斯说。当一个聪明的城市被宣布时，人们的实际情况往往与人们的预期不一致。“我认为有一种误解，当有人评估是否有一个智能城市时，人们会说，‘一座城市里没有100%个完整的建筑，把所有的东西都连接起来。”“ROM交通灯，水系统，电网和一切”，但现实是，大多数客户正在采取一个，两个，三个，四个用例，这是最重要的在那个特定的区域，并实际建设反对，“罗宾斯解释说。”人们的期望是那里。当一个城市变得智能化时，它将成为一个巨大的发光光环，对每个人来说都是显而易见的，它是一个智能城市。“每个城市都在看很多不同的东西，我们通常参与了世界各地所有这些项目中的每一个。”罗宾斯告诉ZDNET，思科公司还参与了从中国开始帮助建立一个更完整的PICT的智能城市。世界上很少有国家能从地面上清理土地和建设智慧城市，但你可以猜出其中的一个是谁，我们实际上正在与中国的一些人合作，他们现在只是在斯塔提。他说：“NG，他们正在建造整个东西。”在这种情况下，你可以建立一个整体智慧城市——在其他情况下，当你翻新的时候，我想你必须在一开始就定义这个体系结构。“在思科Live期间，拉斯维加斯市首席创新官Michael Sherwood说。一个项目已经看到他与思科合作，防止在全城的行人死亡。“我们如何检测交叉路口附近的失误，我们如何使用这些数据，然后改变交叉路口的设计和建造方式，我们如何使用我们收集的情报。这些传感器可能会采取调解措施吗？舍伍德说：“也许我们可以抢先把灯从绿色变为红色，以避免它发生，所以在任何程度上失去生命，无论是上学途中的小孩，还是市民或旅游者，我们真的想了解我们如何预防事故，并拥有这样的能力。实时数据的PE确实改变了我们的外观和设计十字路口的方式。“拉斯维加斯市也在设计一个自主的穿梭机，它知道有多少人在每一站停车并相应地规划空间；路边监控系统，这样车辆就可以有停车的空间了；舍伍德说：“当它需要的时候，而不是一周一次。”这一切都是关于将政府与公民联系起来，并将公民与经验和设施连接起来。同时，卡里镇首席信息官Nicole Raimundo说，她的小镇已经与思科在智能P上合作。一个例子，包括一个例子，包括在交通灯熄灭时发生的智能过程。“我们的愿景是，一旦发生这种情况，它就会自动发送一个工作指令，它将视频流到我们的311个中心，在那里他们可以拥有。好好看看发生了什么，它也会通过威尔重新路由，“她说，”它也会向警察部门发射一些东西，这样他们就可以在那里找个人来帮助指挥交通。因此，我们对技术的愿景并不是每天都能理解或看到的，而是会自动发生，他们的生活将会改善。”鹿特丹港的主管Erwin Rademaker说，他的公司已经使用思科的动力平台，同时增加了数百万个传感器。它的运作是为了追踪进出荷兰港的货船的潮汐、水位、风和盐度。“思科是关键——它的动力部分将所有安全和所有数据从这些关键任务的传感器中提取出来，送到IBM Watson平台上。”星期二，思科在鹿特丹进行了援助。ReMead还说，Cisc也希望改善其安全性。
While the delivery of smart cities solutions requires an overarching plan, they often end up being deployed one project at a time, while focusing on the bigger picture had actually slowed down Cisco in its smart cities push previously, CEO Chuck Robbins has told ZDNet."I think it's like any other complex technology architecture; I think you should have some idea of what the end state looks like, but the reality is if you're going to start from there, you'll never do anything," Robbins told ZDNet during Cisco Live 2018 in Orlando."I think this is one of the problems we had for many years -- we got caught up trying to do a lot."Smart cities deployments therefore end up being rolled out one project at a time depending on what the most required use cases for a given city are, he said, such as smart parking, traffic management, smart lighting, and waste management.According to Robbins, this reality is often at odds with what people have come to expect when a smart city is announced."I think there's a misconception that when someone assesses whether there's a smart city or not, people say, 'well, there's not a 100 percent complete architecture across a city that connects everything from traffic lights to water systems, to electrical grids and everything', but the reality is is most customers are taking one, two, three, four use cases that are the most important in that particular region, and actually building against that," Robbins explained."People's expectation is that there's going to be a big glowing halo around a city when it becomes smart, and it's going to be obvious to everyone that it's a smart city ... every city's looking at a lot of different things, and we're typically involved in most every one of those projects around the world right now."Robbins told ZDNet that Cisco is additionally involved in helping build smart cities in China from the ground up, which does allow for a more complete picture to be drawn prior to deployment."There's very few countries in the world that are actually clearing land and building smart cities from the ground up, but you can guess who one of them is, and we're actually partnering on a number of those in China right now where they literally are just starting and they're building the entire thing," he told ZDNet."In that case, you can build a holistic smart city -- in other cases, when you're retrofitting, I think you have to define that architecture at the start."Speaking during Cisco Live, City of Las Vegas chief innovation officer Michael Sherwood said one project has seen him working with Cisco on preventing pedestrian fatalities throughout the city."How do we detect near misses at intersections, how do we use that data then to change the way that intersections are designed and built, how do we use that intelligence that we're gathering from these sensors to maybe take mediation steps?" Sherwood said."Maybe we can pre-empt the light to change from green to red to avoid it happening, so the loss of life at any level, whether it be a young child on their way to school or a citizen or a tourist to the city, we really want to understand how we can prevent accidents, and having this type of real-time data really changes the way we look and design intersections."The City of Las Vegas is also working on an autonomous shuttle that knows how many people are waiting at each stop and plans space accordingly; kerb-monitoring systems so vehicles can have space to stop; and street sweeping when it's required rather than just once a week."It's all about connecting government to citizens, and connecting citizens with experiences and amenities," Sherwood said.The Town of Cary chief information officer Nicole Raimundo, meanwhile, said her town had partnered with Cisco on intelligent parking lot and traffic solutions, and is likewise using the One example included the intelligent processes that take place when a traffic light goes out."Our vision is that as soon as that happens, it sends off a work order automatically, it streams the video to our 311 centre, where they can have a good look at what's going on, it'll also reroute via Waze," she said."It'll also fire off something to the police department, so they can get someone out there to start to help direct traffic. So our vision with the technology is not so much that they will understand or see it every day; it's just going to automatically happen, their lives will improve."Erwin Rademaker, director of the Port of Rotterdam, said his company has used Cisco's Kinetic platform while adding millions of sensors into its operations to track tides, water levels, wind, and salinity for cargo ships entering and leaving the Dutch port."Cisco is key -- the Kinetic part of it delivers all security and all data extraction from these mission-critical sensors and delivers it to the IBM Watson platform," Rademaker said at Cisco Live on Tuesday.Rademaker added that the Port of Rotterdam is also looking to improve its security offerings, with Cisco providing "the physical part of it"."The second part we want to really try out is blockchain technology," he explained.Cisco's focus on smart cities also saw the company announce a
