North Korea, the US, Russia, and Africa are all associated with different forms of cyberattack.The US first emerged on the scene as a place where state-sponsored groups were given the funds and resources to launch debilitating attacks through Since then, the United States' National Security Agency (NSA) has endured their cache of zero-day exploits and hacking tools North Korea is However, it seems that Iran is also keen to get in on the action.In theThe cybersecurity firm's iDefense threat intelligence team says it has seen a "significant" uptick in not only cyberattacks but also cyberespionage campaigns launched by hackers in the country.During the first half of 2018, Accenture says attacks emerging from Iran grew and this trend is likely to continue. The researchers say that state-sponsored attacks, in particular, have increased -- and together with hacktivists in the country, they represent a "disruptive or destructive cyberthreat against the United States, Europe, and the Middle East."However, Accenture believes that the focus of the groups will be on other Middle Eastern nations.Mobile malware, including Android-based exploits and ransomware, is Iran's current "weapons of choice." Unofficial Android app marketplaces which are not verified by the Google Play app store are common targets for Iranian threat actors seeking to implant malware into mobile devices -- but these same groups are also constantly attempting to secrete malicious code into legitimate apps hosted by Google's official app store.Accenture has also been tracking an Iranian group called Pipefish. These threat actors are active across the Middle East and appear to be targeting organizations in countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates for cyberespionage purposes.Malware developed by the Iranian hacking group and analyzed by researchers shows that the toolset is advancing, as Pipefish is now able to use a cache of exploits to remotely execute commands on victim machines.However, custom ransomware appears to be the tool of choice. Accenture believes that Iranian threat groups will focus on "iDefense threat intelligence analysts predict that actors in Iran will continue to develop and deploy ransomware that they have repurposed from popular malware," the company says. "State-sponsored organizations such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Cyber Command could use such ransomware."It has also been suggested that with US President Trump set to re-impose sanctions on the country, this may prompt new growth in cyberattacks and surveillance campaigns.
