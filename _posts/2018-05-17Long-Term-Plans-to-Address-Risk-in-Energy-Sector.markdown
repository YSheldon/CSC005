AIn addition to planning to curb supply-chain risk and boosting threat-sharing with the private sector, the plan also sets forth the intention to accelerate research and development to make energy systems more resilient to hacking.“Reliable energy and power is the cornerstone of our advanced digital economy and is essential for critical operations in transportation, water, communications, finance, food and agriculture, emergency services, and more,” the plan stated.The White House administration has requested $96m in the 2019 federal budget, and the energy sector plan will also serve as as roadmap on how to best allocate funds for the new office of cybersecurity, energy security, and emergency response.Many welcome the DOE’s efforts to raise awareness around the threats to the energy sector, but Ray DeMeo, chief operating officer, “While the strategy pillars are sound, making them actionable will be challenging. It's critical that we invest with speed and agility, and the roadmap’s goal to accelerate game-changing RDD of resilient systems stands out. The administration’s funding request for $96m is hopefully just a down payment, because protecting our infrastructure adequately will cost billions."
