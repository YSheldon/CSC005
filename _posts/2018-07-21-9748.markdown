Today's opening of the long-sought VA hospital in Aurora is a credit to the perseverance of ColoradoÂ’s veterans. Now, hundreds of thousands of Rocky Mountain veterans can receive the care they deserve. After all our veterans have done for us, that is the least we can do for them. https://t.co/XHXluTtqPv
