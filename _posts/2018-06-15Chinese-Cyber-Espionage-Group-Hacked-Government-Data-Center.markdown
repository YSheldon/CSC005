一个与中国有关的网络间谍单位入侵了一个属于中亚国家的数据中心，并在政府网站上嵌入了恶意代码。数据中心的黑客事件发生在2017年11月中旬，据一名专家指派LukMySub的代号给该组织。这种黑客攻击，但后来他们意识到，袭击者是一个更老的中国威胁演员，在其他网络安全公司的报告中被称为不同的名字，如间谍熊猫、APT27、威胁集团3390、青铜联盟、ZIPToG和铁虎。数据中心向政府网站添加JavaScript代码，它将用户重定向到托管开发工具的恶意站点，例如在这些站点上，这些工具将试图通过HyrBro来感染用户，HyrBro是通过“内存中”状态操作的远程访问木马，在D上留下最小痕迹。研究人员说，他们发现了从2017年12月到2018年1月发生的最终用户感染运动的证据。卡巴斯基没有说出中亚国家的名字，但他们说LukMySube在之前的竞选活动中曾瞄准过Russi。一个反病毒供应商也没有说黑客是如何破坏数据中心托管政府网站的，因为他们没有足够的证据来制定结论。另一个细节也很突出，就是LykMyWork似乎已经入侵了MikROTIK路由器来承载命令和控制服务器。大鼠。攻击者将使用这个路由器来控制和检索受感染的受害者的数据，在他们、受害者和法医调查人员之间附加一层匿名性。这不是民族国家黑客第一次使用路由器作为攻击基础设施的一部分，这是“T”。他最不寻常和有趣的地方是目标。一个国家数据中心是一个有价值的数据来源，也可以被滥用来破坏官方网站。”卡巴斯基专家Denis Legezo解释道。另一个有趣的观点是MikROTIK路由器，我们认为它是专门针对该活动进行黑客攻击的。
A Chinese-linked cyber-espionage unit has hacked a data center belonging to a Central Asian country and has embedded malicious code on government sites.The hack of the data center happened sometime in mid-November 2017, according to a Experts assigned the codename of LuckyMouse to the group behind this hack, but they later realized the attackers were an older Chinese threat actor known under various names in the reports of other cyber-security firms, such as Emissary Panda, APT27, Threat Group 3390, Bronze Union, ZipToken, and Iron Tiger [Kaspersky researchers say LuckyMouse used access to the data center to add JavaScript code to government sites, which redirected users to malicious sites hosting exploitation tools such as On these sites, these tools would attempt to infect users with HyperBro, a remote access trojan that operated via an "in-memory" state, leaving minimal traces on disk that could be identified by antivirus solutions.Researchers say they found evidence of this end-user infection campaign taking place from December 2017 to January 2018.Kaspersky didn't name the Central Asian country, but they did say LuckyMouse targeted it before in previous campaigns.The Russian antivirus vendor also didn't say how hackers breached the data center hosting government sites, as they didn't have enough evidence to formulate a conclusion.Another detail that also stood out was that LuckyMouse appears to have hacked a MikroTik router to host the command and control server of the HyperBro RAT. Attackers would use this router to control and retrieve data from infected victims, putting an additional layer of anonymity between them, victims, and forensic investigators.This is not the first time that nation-state hackers have used routers as part of their attack infrastructure, this being "The most unusual and interesting point here is the target. A national data center is a valuable source of data that can also be abused to compromise official websites," Kaspersky expert Denis Legezo explained. "Another interesting point is the Mikrotik router, which we believe was hacked specifically for the campaign."
