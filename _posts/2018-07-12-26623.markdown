Social media giant fined in the UK for failing to protect usersÂ personal information and for a lack of transparency tttttttttttttttFacebook is facing its first possible The social media giant was hit with a Ĺ500,000 ($663,000) fine for the data breaches Â the maximum allowed Â by the UKÂs Information CommissionerÂs Office (ICO) on Wednesday.When handing down the penalty the UKÂs data protection watchdog stated: ÂFacebook contravened the law by failing to safeguard peopleÂs information. It also found that the company failed to be transparent about how peopleÂs data was harvested by others.ÂThe fine Â the first tangible punishment handed down to Facebook in the wake of the scandal Â is for two breaches of the UKÂs Data Protection Act 1998.While the potential fine will be viewed as a pittance for Facebook Â a view reinforced by the first quarter report that put the companyÂs earnings at $11.97 billion for the period Â it is a warning of sorts to other companies of what may lie in store if they do not adhere to the new Due to the timing of the breaches the ICO was unable to hit the company with much tougher penalties introduced by this new legislation directive, which could have resulted in fines of up to 4% of FacebookÂs global turnover Â an estimated $1.9 billion.Elizabeth Denham, the UKÂs Information Commissioner said, ÂFacebook has failed to provide the kind of protections they are required to under the Data Protection Act.Â She added, ÂPeople cannot have control over their own data if they donÂt know or understand how it is being used. ThatÂs why greater and genuine transparency about the use of data analytics is vital.ÂFacebook has a chance to respond to the CommissionerÂs Notice of Intent, after which a final decision will be made, reads the statement.tttttttttttttttttttttttttt
