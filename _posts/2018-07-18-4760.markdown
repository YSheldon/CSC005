Those advisors include Pankaj Patel, former EVP and chief development officer of Cisco; Amarjit Gill, an entrepreneur who founded and sold companies to According to Arrcus CEO Devesh Garg, these advisors were needed to help the company really turn the table on the existing way of deploying switches and unraveling the hardware from the software. We felt that we could do something at scale and much bigger than what was currently being done, he said. We needed people who understood the market and what we are trying to do.One of the limitations of existing operating systems is that they are constrained by legacy software necessary to support the older hardware. We see innovation at the chip level and the component level, Garg said. But no one was bringing that together with the software.Besides the DPAL, ArcOS uses standards-based The ArcOS is supported on Broadcoms StrataDNX Jerico+ and StrataXGS Trident 3 silicon platforms, which Garg said makes it the first independent OS to be available on the Broadcom platforms.Garg pointed to But what about Garg said that he doesnt really know much about the DANOS strategy but thinks it is a positive development for the industry. Its positive from the perspective that you have a large service provider that is forthright with what it is doing.
