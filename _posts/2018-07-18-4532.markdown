The top federal authority on elections is seeking to reassure a security-focused lawmaker that it is doing everything in its power to provide state election officials with all available resources in order to secure equipment and computer systems.The heads of the Election Assistance Commission were responding to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., In the response letter obtained by CyberScoop, EAC commissioners Thomas Hicks and Christy McCormick lay out the many ways the commission works with states on election security, including developing testing requirements and voting machine standards, offering guidance for spending federal grants and informing states about services available from other agencies.Earlier this year, Congress In his June letter, Wyden sought to learn how major cybersecurity concerns would be communicated to states as they decide how to spend their piece of the HAVA funding. While much of the PR surrounding the $380 million has been related to cybersecurity, there is no statutory requirement that states use it for that; they could theoretically hire more staff, implement basic IT upgrades or even take actions that make their elections less secure.The commissioners note in their letter to Wyden that the EAC has held live webinars, conference calls and an April The importance of election security and how the newly appropriated HAVA Funds will assist states with meeting these objectives are the Commissions top priority and part of our primary focus, the letter says.The EAC Wyden also wanted to know the EACs position on allowing independent security experts to investigate voting systems security through penetration testing, red-teaming and vulnerability testing, which he said would a common-sense requirement before certification.The commissioners deferred to DHS and state election officials. Homeland Security does make vulnerability assessments available to states, the commissioners said.

In many cases, the jurisdictions require the products to be certified by the EAC and comply with the commissions Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG). Access to machines by independent researchers, however, In response to a question about whether the EAC has staff dedicated to cybersecurity, the commissioners wrote that there are three full-time employees working in the Testing and Certification Program. Also, a number of staff members have Beyond that, the letter says that $1.5 million of the commissions annual operating budget goes to the National Institute for Standards and Technology, as the government standards body provides the EAC with regular technical support.Although our budget is small by federal government standards, the EAC has a track record of nimbly carrying out the commissions [Help America Vote Act] mandated mission, and the EAC has extended that support to provide leadership to the election industry related to cybersecurity, the letter says.You can read the EACs full response to Wyden below.
