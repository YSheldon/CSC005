Former employees represent 13% of cybersecurity incidents for the participating organizations.According to this years survey, despite the reality that internal threats are the greatest risk to most organizations, employees believe that the majority of incidents (62%) are accidental, which is only a slight decrease from 65% in 2017.Although theres a slight decrease in numbers in the EMEA region, the results once again highlight the insider threat as being the chief source of cybersecurity incidents, Dr. Guy Bunker, SVP of products at Clearswift, said in a press release. Three-quarters of incidents are still coming from within the business and its extended enterprise, far greater than the threat from external hackers. Businesses need to shift the focus inwards."Organizations need to have a process for tracking the flow of information in the business and have a clear view on who is accessing it and when," Bunker continued. "Businesses need to also ensure that employees buy into the idea that data security is now a critical issue for the business. Educating them on the value of data, on different forms of data, what is shareable and what's not, is crucial to a successful cybersecurity strategy."Given that the percentage changes are so slight, Ben Herzberg, director of threat research at Im not sure if GDPR is the cause of the change in the statistics gathered, but with or without GDPR, its important for organizations to know exactly where they store their data, and be accountable for it.
