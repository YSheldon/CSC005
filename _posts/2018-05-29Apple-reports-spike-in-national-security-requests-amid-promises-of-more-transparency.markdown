The number of data requests from the U.S. government to Apple Inc. more than doubled last year, according to a biannual Apple received 16,249 national security requests across 8,249 accounts between July 1, 2017 and Dec. 31, 2017, almost three times higher than the amount of requests received during the same period in 2016, when the company saw just 5,999 such requests, according to “The national security requests demand that Apple provide information in response to U.S. National Security legal authorities…Though we would like to be more specific, by law this is the most precise information we are currently allowed to disclose,” Apple’s Other major tech firms also saw jumps in national security requests between the end of 2016 and the first half of 2017, Reuters reports.
