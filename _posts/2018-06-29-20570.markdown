A team of academics has published research yesterday that describes three attacks against the mobile communication standard Two of the three attacks are passive, meaning an attacker can watch LTE traffic and determine various details about the target, while the third is an active attack that lets the attacker manipulate data sent to the user's LTE device.According to researchers, the passive attacks allow an attacker to collect meta-information about the user's traffic (an identity mapping attack), while the second allows the attacker to determine what websites a user might be visiting through his LTE device (a website fingerprinting attack).Researchers nicknamed the active attack aLTEr because of its intrusive capabilities, which they used in experiments to redirect users to malicious sites by altering DNS packets (DNS spoofing). Below is a demo of an aLTEr attack recorded by researchers.But researchers said regular users have nothing to fear, for now. Carrying out any of the three attacks requires special and expensive equipment, along with custom software, which usually puts this type of attack out of the reach of most crooks. Researchers explain:"We conducted the attacks in an experimental setup in our lab that depends on special hardware and a controlled environment," researchers said. "These requirements are, at the moment, hard to meet in real LTE networks. However, with some engineering effort, our attacks can also be performed in the wild.""We think that people of special interest such as politicians or journalists are the most likely targets of an attack," researchers added.The equipment needed to pull off such attacks is very similar to so-called "aLTEr attacks are performed similarly, with the attacker needing to trick a victim's LTE device into connecting to it first, and then the attacker's device forwarding traffic to the real telephony tower.As such, proximity to the victim is paramount, and the attack cannot be performed from across the Internet, requiring the attacker's presence on-site.As for the technical details of the three attacks, the three vulnerabilities exist in one of the two LTE layers called the data layer, the one that transports the user's actual data. The other layer is the control layer and that's the one that controls and keeps the user's 4G connection running.According to researchers, the vulnerabilities exist because the data layer is not protected, so an attacker can intercept, alter, and then relay the modified packets to the actual cell tower.They can do this because 4G data packets are not integrity-protected, meaning it's possible to change bits of data, despite the data being encrypted.The research team, made up of three researchers from the Ruhr-University in Bochum, Germany and a researcher from New York University, say they have notified relevant institutions such as the GSM Association (GSMA), 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and telephone companies about the issues they discovered.They warned the issue could also affect the upcoming version of the 5G standard in its current form. Experts said the 5G standard includes additional security features (stronger encryption at the data layer) to prevent aLTEr attacks, but these are currently optional.The research team has published its findings in a research paper entitled "
