I'll be presenting "Crashing to root: How to escape the iOS sandbox using abort()" at @bevxcon this September. I'll show how to exploit CVE-2018-4280, fixed in iOS 11.4.1, by crashing maliciously in order to elevate privileges, defeat codesigning, and spawn a shell on iOS 11.2.6. https://t.co/tRxLqD55fY
