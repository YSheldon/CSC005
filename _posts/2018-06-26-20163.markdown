After the account verification questions, the system demanded that we create a voice ID by repeating the phrase Âmy voice is my passwordÂ,Â it explained in a blog post.ÂFar from ÂencouragingÂ customersÂ, HMRC offers no choice but to do as the automated system instructs and create a biometric voice ID for a government database.ÂThe only way to avoid creating the voice ID is apparently to say ÂnoÂ three times Â something most users wouldnÂt think to do.Big Brother Watch claimed the system may break the law because it doesnÂt obtain explicit consent from users in the form of a positive opt-in, as required by the GDPR.Under the European privacy law, now part of UK law in the form of the Data Protection Act 2018, individuals should have a 'right to erasure', meaning the HMRC has to delete their voice ID if requested.However, the Big Brother Watch investigation concluded that HMRC doesnÂt have an accessible process to do so.
