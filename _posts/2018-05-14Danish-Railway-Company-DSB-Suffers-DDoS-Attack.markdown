That said, a successful attack on the more vulnerable management systems can cause widespread disruption. This DDoS attack on Danish railways ticketing site can be added to a growing list of such cyber-attacks that include last October’s DDoS attack on the Swedish Railways that took out their train ordering system for two days resulting in travel chaos.The lessons are clear, Lloyd added; transportation companies and other operators of essential services have to invest in proactive cybersecurity defenses to ensure that their services can stay online and open for business during a cyber-attack.
