 tThe Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has stated it has been compliant with the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) Top 4 mitigated strategies since November last year.This ebook, based on the latest ZDNet/TechRepublic special feature, offers a detailed look at how to build risk management policies to protect your critical digital assets. tAccording to executive minutes released on Friday, the ATO has improved its governance framework and strengthened its contracts with its suppliers to ensure compliance with the cyber guidelines, has refreshed its cybersecurity strategy, and has a program of work to make its systems more resilient. tThe tax office said an independent review will occur to verify its compliance with the Top 4, and that it is working towards meeting thetAlongside the then-Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the ATO was called out by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) in March last year for havingt"The Australian Taxation Office's and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection's self-assessments both reported compliance against three of the Top 4 mitigation strategies," the ANAO report said. t"The ANAO assessed that the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection complied with only two and one of the Top 4 mandatory strategies, respectively." tIn response to report, the ATO said it would become compliant in 2017. tA subsequent ANAO report in November found the ATO did not effectivelyt"The ATO needs to ensure greater conformance to processes for estimating and monitoring project costs, savings, and benefits, to provide transparency about the net benefits of programs and support decisions about the commencement, continuation, resourcing, and direction of projects," the ANAO said at the time. t tAn ANAO report in February highlighted thet"This contract exposes the ATO to contractual and operational risks in the absence of measurable service levels," ANAO wrote at the time. tAt a March hearing, the ATO backed itstSpeaking last week to Senate Estimates, freshly minted ASD director-general Mike Burgess said taking a checklist approach to security is not always a good approach. t"Compliance with a list is not by itself good security," Burgess said. "There is no doubt [ANAO's] findings are their findings, but from that you should not necessarily draw that the heads of those departments, the agency heads, are not taking their responsibilities seriously, and they do work hard to identify and manage their security risks." tAccording to the ASD chief, the existence of legacy IT systems is hampering some agencies from implementing the mandated Top 4 Mitigation Strategies issued by the Signals Directorate. t"If you can't implement that because your IT systems are old and in need of investment, you can still manage that risk effectively by having other security controls in place that help you identify a problem," he said.
