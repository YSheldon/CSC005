The Free Software Movement of India has The letter also highlights YouTube videos “which claim to demonstrate how using a software patch to the ECMP software, geo-location and bio-metric security protection can be bypassed”, similar to the one below that allow new Aadhaar enrolments without verification and updating of personal information of existing Aadhaar numbers. Such as this one:The FSMI terms call this a very serious concern as it endangers the sanctity of the entire Aadhaar database and asks whether the UIDAI authority has carried out an examination of these claims and if there is any merit to these claims.The letter also draws attention to a PayTM account mentioned in the YouTube video that was tracked down to a Bharat B. Who claimed to work for the Computer Sciences Corporation e-governance division. The letter asks the UIDAI whether the patched software could be the case of rogue insiders misusing their access to the software to create an illegal patched version.The letter asks UIDAI the following questions regarding the reported hack:The letter concludes by saying that the ongoing silence of the UIDAI on the issue is “fuelling speculations and rumours regarding what is supposed to be India’s key data service.”The UIDAI hasn’t actually been silent about the issue. It has promptly issued a canned denial that The letter raises valid questions. Several credible organizations and individuals working with software and security have raised similar questions in the past as well. The Mozilla Foundation has There are several videos that appear to demonstrate the bypassing of UIDAI’s security features in the ECMP software for Aadhaar Enrolment – most of them appear to provide a phone number to contact in order to get the patch for the software and payments through PayTM. The illegal access reported in the Tribune expose was offered on WhatsApp as well, and required the payment to be made via PayTM.So far, there are no reports of any of the people selling illegal hacks to access the UIDAI database being traced or arrested, even though a few people to purchase hacked software have been arrested. This also raises serious questions about UIDAI’s ability to not just prevent misuse, but also investigate it after it has happened. The role of PayTM in enabling criminal transactions too needs to be investigated, given that payments are made through the platform and yet no one has been traced or arrested.The letter refers to Bharat B as working for the Computer Sciences Corporation. Actually, Computer Sciences Corporation is a US Company and the CSC that Bharat B is likely to have worked for is likely to be the Common Service Centers that are physical facilities for delivering Government of India e-It is this CSC – Common Service Centres – that had a contract with the UIDAI for conducting enrolments and has, in fact enroled about a fifth of the Aadhaar numbers in the database.
