No user interaction is needed in order to exploit the vulnerability. As of the security advisory publication on 15 May, there have been no known public exploitations.Â The vulnerability, with a CVSS v3.0 base score of 7.5, affects theÂ SIMATIC S7-400 CPU hardware v.4.0 and below, whichÂ are being phased out. The products in this family, which are used worldwide,Â have been designed for process control in industrial environments across the automotive industry and in mechanical equipment manufacturers, warehousing systems, building engineering, the steel industry, power generation and distribution, pharmaceuticals, the food and beverage industryÂ and the chemical industry.The vulnerability echoes the ongoing discussions about critical infrastructure security, andÂ Andrew Lloyd, president of "There is a genuine risk of service disruption, malware infestation and/or safety if control equipment such as these PLCs is exposed on the Internet where the full pandemic of cyber-threats (including DDoS) is there to exploit their vulnerabilities," Lloyd said.Also vulnerable are all firmware below v.5.2 and SIMANTIC S7-400H CPU hardware v.4.5 and below.Â For customers that have not yet upgraded their hardware and firmware,Â SiemensÂ offered additional mitigation strategies.Â Customers can apply theÂ "Best practice advice would have the control networks that these PLCs form be completely isolated from the Internet, " said Lloyd. "Older PLC equipment was not designed with Internet exposure in mind. Consequently, many have little or no security to protect them from being compromised."
