However, Recorded Future claimed to have identified over 4000 routers still exposed to this kind of attack.Utilizing the above-mentioned method, the hacker first infiltrated the computer of a captain at 432d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Reaper AMU OIC, stationed at the Creech AFB in Nevada, and stole a cache of sensitive documents, Recorded Future then observed the same cyber-criminal attempting to sell information which appeared to have been stolen from the US military or a Pentagon official.This included a dozen various training manuals describe improvised explosive device defeat tactics, an M1 ABRAMS tank operation manual, a crewman training and survival manual, and tank platoon tactics.The incident should serve as something of a wake-up call to the US military in that it highlights what a single hacker with moderate technical skills was able to achieve in just a week.
