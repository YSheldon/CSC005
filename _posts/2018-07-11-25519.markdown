In the run-up to CambodiaÂs general election on July 29, a hacking group tied to China has been breaking into multiple organizations that share a connection to either the countryÂs main opposition party, voting process or human rights movement, according The FireEye collected this intelligence by directly accessing the attack servers, which werenÂt protected with a password. The firm was able to identify breaches through established lines of communication that existed between the servers and victims.The hacking group in question, known as ÂTEMP.Periscope,Â has been tied According to FireEye, the impacted Cambodian organizations include: the National Election Commission, members of parliament representing the National Rescue Party (CNRP), a Cambodian political party; high-profile Cambodians whoÂve publicly advocated for human rights; and at least two unnamed Cambodian media entities.ItÂs not just the opposition thatÂs been hacked by TEMP.Periscope.Several leading government agencies that are largely controlled by the ruling political party, the Cambodian PeopleÂs Party (CPP), have also been breached. Those attacked organizations Â which are responsible forÂ both domestic and foreign policy Â include theÂ Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cambodian Senate, and Ministry of Economics and Finance, according to FireEye.ÂTEMP.Periscope is one of the most active Chinese groups of 2018,Â said FireEye Senior Analyst Ben Read. ÂWe have high confidence that TEMP.Periscope is acting on behalf of the Chinese government.ÂThe primary method of infiltration appears to be well-crafted phishing emails, which mention local news events. Additionally, some intrusions leveraged watering hole-style booby-trapped websites, FireEye stated in a blog post published late Tuesday.ÂThe phishing emails demonstrated knowledge of the subject, but nothing that would have been impossible to gather from open sources as far as we saw,Â Read said. ÂThey also appeared to be using SCANBOX [software] to profile and potentially infect victims.ÂSo far, the activity has remained isolated to digital espionage, although the potential for actual sabotage is possible due to the active nature of the breaches.In one case, researchers were able to trace a related data breach to an IP address in Hainan, China. The farming island on ChinaÂs southern coast is home to several naval and intelligence installations operated by the PeopleÂs Liberation Army (PLA).Prior reporting by theÂ ÂThe lesson I would take is that there are a broad array of groups interested in elections,Â Read said.The hacks underscore BeijingÂs complex relationship withÂ CambodiaÂs ruling authoritarian regime led byÂ Prime Minister Hun Sen.Over the last several years, Sen has tightened his grip on the country by using the government to prosecute opposition leaders, control local media, and sell off land assets to foreign investors. His regime is also known for its use ofÂ Sen is widely seen as an ally to BeijingÂs existing geopolitical interests in the region, including ChinaÂs ongoing territorial conquest in the South China Sea.Foreign policy experts expect the CPP to win the national election in a landslide; in part due to corruption and voting manipulation. The assumed voting result begs the question of why China is so intent on monitoring the election.ÂWhile Cambodia is rated as Authoritarian by the EconomistÂs Democracy Index, the recent surprise upset of the ruling party in Malaysia may motivate China to closely monitor CambodiaÂs July 29 elections,Â FireEye stated. ÂThe targeting of the election commission is particularly significant Â There is not yet enough information to determine why the organization was compromised Â simply gathering intelligence or as part of a more complex operation.ÂA spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in D.C. did not respond to a request for comment.In an emailed statement, a member of CambodiaÂs main opposition party, the CNRP, said she was disturbed by the revelation.ÂI am not surprised but disturbed by it. I hope with this, the international community now look at CambodiaÂs current crisis in regional context. ItÂs important that Cambodia not fall under the influence of any one particular country where our interests can be compromised,Â said Monovithya Kem, deputy director of public affairs for the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).
