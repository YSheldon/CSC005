Spectre is a flaw that an attacker can exploit to force a CPU to reveal its data.”Rob Tate, distinguished security researcher at The vulnerabilities were assigned "If an attacker has access to run code on a machine, there are already a number of simpler (and more universal) techniques to try before resorting to this, and it’s far from the wide-reaching implications of the original Spectre. So, while patches should be applied when possible, Intel is right to call this a Medium," said Tate. The more commonly useful a vulnerability, the more it helps attackers simplify their process; thus, the easier it becomes for non-skilled hackers to compromise more computers.In an industry where people are trained to expect speed, it's not uncommon to see the vast majority of people choose speed over security, said Renaud Deraison, co-founder and CTO of “In this case," continued Deraison, "the vulnerabilities take advantage of the very features that make them fast. Intel optimized for performance and later learned they were facing a trade-off between security and performance."In their
