一位身份不明的黑客在比特币黄金密码基础设施上安装了几次“双花钱”攻击，并在这一过程中积累了价值超过1800万美元的BTG（比特币黄金）硬币。超过一半的比特币黄金网络HASTER被称为“51%次攻击”。这使得攻击者能够修改BBCH链交易的细节，这是他在过去几天中使用的一种能力，可以执行第二次攻击，称为“双花费”。ES，允许他花同样数量的硬币两次。根据比特币黄金队，这个攻击者已经使用了51%和双花钱攻击的组合来骗取密码交换服务。“安装持续攻击的成本很高。比特币金币团队解释说，由于成本高，攻击者只能从假存款中快速获得高价值的东西获利。交易方可以自动接受大额存款，允许用户快速换成不同的硬币，然后自动退出。这就是他们瞄准交易所的原因。“在过去的几天里，攻击者一直在这样做。他在交易所里存了大量的BTG硬币，但也把同样的资金投向自己的钱包。当交易所意识到B股链已经被篡改，交易无效时，黑客已经从交易所撤回了资金，并使原来的资金翻了一倍。为了抵御攻击，交易所在过去几天里提高了确认BTG交易所需的门槛，但黑客继续部署越来越多的矿业权来接管超过一半的比特币黄金网络，并实施双重支出攻击。比特币黄金团队说，它跟踪了从交易所被盗的资金到超过388000个BTG硬币的BTG地址已经通过这个账户，这表明黑客已经从他的攻击中赚了1800万美元。很明显，黑客并没有从用户那里窃取钱财，而是从E。Xchange。虽然没有用户丢失资金，但攻击仍然是危险的，因为它们可能会破坏交易所的备用资金，或者可能导致破产，从而可能阻止用户撤回资金。用户现在可能不会赔钱，但如果继续攻击，一些交易所可能会走。破产和无法退还用户仍然保持资金与交易所。根据一个交换门户网站，谁与比特币黄金队合作，以达到这些攻击的底部，他们还相信在过去一周的事件背后的人/团体也尝试相同的。在过去的比特币网络攻击中，比特币黄金是一种非常流行的密码，它是由原始比特币在2017年11月分叉而成，目前基于总市值上限排名27。
An unidentified hacker has mounted several "double spend" attacks on the infrastructure of the Bitcoin Gold cryptocurrency and has managed to amass over $18 million worth of BTG (Bitcoin Gold) coins in the process.According to a The attacker has been deploying a large number of servers to take control of more than half of the Bitcoin Gold's network hashrate in what's known as a "51% attack."This grants the attacker the ability to modify details of blockchain transactions, an ability he's been using in the last few days to perform a second attack called "double spend," which as the name implies, allows him to spend the same amount of coins twice.According to the Bitcoin Gold team, this attacker has been using this combination of a 51% and double-spend attack to defraud cryptocurrency exchange services."The cost of mounting an ongoing attack is high. Because the cost is high, the attacker can only profit if they can quickly get something of high value from a fake deposit," the Bitcoin Gold team explained. "A party like an Exchange may accept large deposits automatically, allow the user to trade into a different coin quickly, and then withdraw automatically. This is why they are targeting Exchanges."For the last few days, the attacker has been doing just this. He's been depositing large amounts of BTG coins at exchanges, but also sending the same funds to his own wallet.By the time exchanges realize the blockchain has been tampered with and that the transaction is invalid, the hacker has already withdrawn funds from the exchange and doubled his original funds.To counteract attacks, exchanges have been raising the threshold needed to confirm a BTG transaction in the past few days, but the hacker has continued to deploy more and more mining power to take over more than half of the Bitcoin Gold network and carry out the double-spend attack anyway.The Bitcoin Gold team says it tracked the funds stolen from exchanges to a BTG address located at More than 388,000 BTG coins have passed through this account, suggesting the hacker has made over $18 million from his attacks.To be clear, the hacker hasn't been stealing money from users, but from the exchanges. While no user has lost money, the attacks are still dangerous because they might destabilize an exchange's backup funds, or may lead to its insolvency, which in turn may prevent users from withdrawing funds.Users may not be losing money right now, but if the attacks continue, some exchanges may go bankrupt and won't be able to refund users still keeping funds with the exchange.According to one of the exchange portals who collaborated with the Bitcoin Gold team to get to the bottom of these attacks, they also believe the person/group behind this past week's events has also attempted the same attack on the original Bitcoin network in the past.Bitcoin Gold is a very popular cryptocurrency created by forking the original Bitcoin currency in November 2017, currently ranked #27 based on total market cap.
