星期三晚上，Hon Angus Taylor说：“实际上，阻止机器人对澳大利亚人来说就像停船一样重要，”执法委员会和网络安全部部长马克斯•梅德韦杰夫（Mr.Mp）说。女士们，先生们，这是支持澳大利亚政府即将出台的立法的标准，旨在使解密的信息在没有他们或通信提供者的情况下对执法人员可获得加密密钥。联合政府推翻了国际难民安置令人难以置信的复杂问题，将廉价的三字口号称为“主权边界行动”，并将其视为成功。你看不见船，所以问题就解决了，对吧？泰勒说：“在我看来，它缺乏细微之处是绝对重要的。”TSO现在，同样的智力复杂的方法将是解决国际网络犯罪和网络治国的令人难以置信的复杂性的解决方案。TTT吸引观众的分析是诱人的，那是悉尼研究所，一个由两个困惑的老人为其他困惑的人所经营的组织，也就是那些认为西方文明濒临崩溃的极右派保守主义者。孤独才是真正的冠军。也就是说，那些支持联盟的人，首相不敢忽视他，免得他被废黜。TSO值得关注他们被告知的内容，因为这是一个会引起公众争论的框架，至少在堪培拉新闻界抓住这个问题的时候。泰勒说：“我相信我们现在面临比以往任何时候都更严重的威胁，而且是一种不同的威胁。”但是，在援引了十亿人死亡的图像之后，最终是一个核冬天，有可能摧毁地球上的生命，这一威胁很快被降级为通常的分类：“现代有组织的犯罪贩毒和洗钱、恐怖主义、网络犯罪和网络儿童性犯罪。NCES“。在我们的机构中，有一系列关于失去信任的声明，“只有26%的澳大利亚人相信政府中的人是可以信任的”，在他所在的Goulburn的家中从来没有出现过一个棘手的毒品问题——这是一个不太可能的主张——而且这是劳工的F。在我听到过的最精彩的比较之一之前，药物是如此容易被导入。澳大利亚是全球最成功的铁矿石行业，花了几十年的时间才建成。跨国犯罪网络在短短几年内就形成了一个全球性的供应链。“Tayelor最大的恐惧是我们再也不能信任任何人或任何东西了。事实是，对我们的选举系统、空中交通管制、银行、电网或电信网络的灾难性网络攻击会破坏我们对生活绝对中心的信心。当然，如果我们不再相信这些活动，这些机构和机构，他们就会失败，”他说。它以一种迂回的方式最终将我们带回了CyBrs，至少最初是支持加密。谷歌已经超过93%的服务和数据被加密了，超过84%的网页是通过他们的Chrome浏览器加载的。这对于网络安全来说是非常棒的，政府对此表示欢迎。我们相信，我们需要加强[加密]，如果我们的网络和通信是值得信赖的，“泰勒说。但是，通常的抱怨是，坏人也使用加密，执法机构需要在适当授权的情况下访问这些加密消息的内容。Tayelor重申政府否认他们在后门，增加了一些奇怪的额外信息。现在有人争辩说，机构应该有权获得所谓的“金钥匙”——一个特殊的密钥，在那里你可以打开，你可以解密数据。技术部门已经大力反对这一说法，称这会给他们的设备和系统带来所谓的“后门”或威胁，“他说。在接下来的几周里，我们将开始讨论新的立法，这将使我们的电信拦截和搜查令权力现代化。[这项立法]不会创造“后门”。本届政府承诺不会“后门”。没有必要让执法机构在用户的唯一控制下访问解密密钥。“然后，对我来说，这是最重要的声明。T“我们根本不需要削弱加密，以便得到我们需要的。”这意味着什么？就我个人而言，我认为这是某种语义上的技巧。不希望“解密密钥，否则在用户的唯一控制下”不排除想要一个不在用户的“唯一控制”下的密钥。这就使得密钥托管制度成为可能。这不会削弱加密
 t"Practically speaking, 'stopping the bots' is every bit as important to Australians as 'stopping the boats'," said the Hon Angus Taylor MP, minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security, on Wednesday night. tThat, ladies and gentlemen, is the standard of debate supporting the Australian government's forthcoming legislation that's intended -- somehow -- to make decrypted messages available to law enforcement without them, or the communications provider, having access to the encryption keys. tThe Coalition government dumbed down discussion of the mind-boggling complexities of international refugee resettlement to the cheap three-word slogan of Operation Sovereign Borders, and counts it as a success. You can't see the boats, so that's the problem solved, right? t"Its lack of nuance was absolutely central, in my view, to its success," Taylor said. tSo now that same intellectually sophisticated approach will be the solution to the the mind-boggling complexities of international cybercrime and cyber statecraft. tIt's tempting to leave the analysis oftThe audience, though, was the Sydney Institute, an organisation run by a couple of confused old people for other confused people, namely that species of far-right conservatives who imagine that western civilisation is on the verge of collapse, and that they alone are its true champions. Which is to say, the sort of people whose numbers prop up the Coalition, and who the prime minister dare not ignore lest he be deposed. tSo it's worth paying attention to what they're being told, because this is the framing that will inform public debate, at least once the Canberra press gallery catches on to the issue. t"I believe we are facing now more serious threats, and a different kind of threat, than at any time since the Cold War," Taylor said. tBut having invoked the imagery of a billion deaths and, eventually, a nuclear winter with the potential to destroy life on Earth, the threat is soon downgraded to the usual assortment: "modern organised criminal drug trafficking and money laundering, terrorism, cybercrime and online child sex offences". tThere follows a jumble of statements about the loss of trust in our institutions, that "only 26 percent of Australians believe that people in government can be trusted", that there never used to be a hard drug problem in his regional home of Goulburn -- an unlikely claim -- and that it's Labor's fault that drugs are so easy to import, before one of the most remarkable comparisons I've ever heard. t"Australia's most successful global industry, iron ore, took decades to build. Transnational criminal networks developed a global meth supply chain in a few short years." tTaylor's big fear is that we won't be able to trust anyone or anything any more. t"The truth is that a catastrophic cyber attack on our electoral systems, air traffic control, banks, electricity grids, or telecommunication networks would undermine faith in activities absolutely central to our lives. And of course if we stop trusting those activities, these organisations and institutions, they fail," he said. tWhich, in a roundabout way, finally brings us back to the cybers, and at least initially, support for encryption. t"Already more than 93 percent of Google's services and data are encrypted, as are more than 84 percent of the web pages loaded via their Chrome browser. This is fantastic for cybersecurity, and the government welcomes it. And we believe that we need to strengthen [encryption] if our networks and communications are to be trusted," Taylor said. tBut then comes the usual complaint that Bad People use encryption too, and that law enforcement agencies need access to the content of those encrypted messages when suitably authorised. tTaylor repeated the government's denial that they're after a back door, adding some curious extras. t"Now it's sometimes argued that agencies should have privileged access to what's known as a 'golden key' -- a special key where you can open up, you can decrypt the data. The tech sector has pushed back hard against this, saying that's creating so-called 'backdoors' or threats to the security of their devices and systems," he said. t"In the coming weeks, we'll begin consultation on new legislation that will modernise our telecommunications intercept and search warrant powers. [This legislation] will not create 'backdoors'. This government is committed to no 'backdoors'. It isn't necessary to give law enforcement agencies access to a decryption key otherwise under the sole control of a user." tAnd then, for me, the most significant statement of all. t"We simply don't need to weaken encryption in order to get what we need." tWhat does this mean? Personally, I think it's some semantic sleight of hand. tNot wanting "a decryption key otherwise under the sole control of a user" doesn't exclude wanting a key that isn't under the user's "sole control". That leaves open the possibility of a key escrow system. That wouldn't "weaken encryption", that is to say the algorithm, merely the processes that ensure the users' messages are kept private. tOr it could simply mean what ItWhether it's those things or something else, the government will try to tell you it's not them making these changes, but the messaging providers simply doing what is right and proper, and what has been done in the past, to help stop the criminals. tSorry, as the minister put it: "to protect and rebuild faith in what has made this country great. Only then can we endeavour, like our forebears, to leave our children and grandchildren a better world than the one we inherited."A cyber offensive capability could knock out key infrastructure targets cheaper than conventional military kit, but Australia needs to get its messaging right to avoid triggering the neighbours.The centre's chair has called for an overarching capability that supports federal, state, and territory-based cybercrime-countering efforts, labelling current capacities 'relatively weak'.Demands for more access to private data and control over personal communications devices 'sounds a lot like China', says Obama's director for Cybersecurity Policy.For a country with a culture based on taking things as they come, Check Point has said Australia is taking the threat of cybersecurity seriously.Almost 12 months since Canberra announced plans for a decryption silver bullet, Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Angus Taylor said the legislation is still on its way and it's one of his personal priorities.Australia is charging headlong into a privacy disaster as government open data initiatives come online without considering how to properly implement privacy safeguards and data anonymity.
