The way that these directions were drafted risked nullifying that safeguard, by delegating that power to GCHQ  a violation that went undetected by the system of commissioners for years and was seemingly consented to by all of the telecommunications companies affected, argued PI solicitor, Mille Graham Wood. It is proof positive of the inadequacy of the historic oversight system; the complicity of telecommunications companies who instead of checking if requests were lawful, just handed over customers' personal data as long as their cooperation was kept secret; and the scale of the task facing the new investigatory powers commissioner, Sir Adrian Fulford.
