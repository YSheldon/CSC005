IoTThe Army Corps of Engineers is bringing the internet of things to waste disposal, installing 100 sensors in dumpsters at Fort Carson, Colo.Enevo's small, battery-powered, sensors will be put in dumpsters and containers where they will daily collect data on the temperature, tilt, and fill levels, providing data feeds that allow officials to avoid overfilled containers, spot trends and make predictions about future waste collection needs. Â The companyÂs cloud-based platform uses advanced analytics and a dynamic scheduling and routing engine to determine truck routing maps that maximize resource efficiency and minimize travel distances.Sensor data will be sent over existing, commercial 3G or the Cat M1 IoT cellular infrastructure specifically designed for machine-to-machine communications. The network will be wholly independent of Army Garrison Information Technology networks.Enevo will be installing the sensors and providing six months of cellular subscription service, according to an Army sole-source Enevo's sensors and logistics platform have been deployed in 35 countries -- including a pilot program in Kirkland, Wash., where the city used them to decrease garbage pickups at City Hall.About the AuthorSusan Miller is executive editor at GCN.
