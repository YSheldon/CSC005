Two lawsuits filed by the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab were dismissed Wednesday, ending the Moscow-based companyÂs attempt to lift the U.S. governmentÂs ban on its products.Kaspersky filed the lawsuits after its products were banned from U.S. government systems in both a Binding Operational Directive from the Department of Homeland Security and the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. That ban goes into effectÂ on Oct. 1, 2018.ÂThe NDAA does not inflict ÂpunishmentÂ on Kaspersky Lab,Â Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia, wrote in her opinion. ÂIt eliminates a perceived risk to the nationÂs cybersecurity and, in so doing, has the secondary effect of foreclosing one small source of revenue for a large multinational corporation.ÂThe basis of KasperskyÂs lawsuit was that the bans were unconstitutional and caused undue harm to the company.The ban is constitutional,Â the judge concluded.ÂThese defensive actions may very well have adverse consequences for some third-parties,Â she wrote. ÂBut that does not make them unconstitutional.ÂKollar-Kootelly said that Âtheoretical harmÂ to KasperskyÂs reputation is ÂÂtoo vague and unsubstantiated'Â to warrant action.The judge also waved off KasperskyÂsÂ protests about its Âright to sell to the governmentÂ as Âworthless.ÂÂThis asserted ÂrightÂ is worthless,Â she wrote. ÂTo ÂsellÂ requires another to Âbuy.Â Because no government agency would buy PlaintiffsÂ product in the period before October 1, 2018, PlaintiffsÂ theoretical ÂrightÂ to sell has no value at all in the real world.ÂYou can read the full opinion below.
