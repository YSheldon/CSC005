We have not detected any other such attempts."However, there are concerns that other camera brands supported by Israel-headquartered supplier OzVision may be vulnerable to attack. A problem was discovered in Flir cameras back in October last year, with a patch apparently imminent.Some 40% of UK consumers are concerned that devices can listen in to their private conversations, according to People need to feel empowered and protected so they can embrace new technologies that aim to deliver peace of mind. Businesses manufacturing these devices must do their bit and ensure that security is built-in from the get-go, said chief scientist, Raj Samani.There are also simple measures consumers can take when introducing new connected gadgets to their home environments. For example, people need to ensure they have protected Wi-Fi in place with multi-factor authentication and complex passwords. This will help prevent cyber-criminals from accessing devices and getting their hands on personal information.
