新版本的SAMSAM勒索将不会执行，除非运行恶意软件的有效载荷的人通过命令行进入特殊密码。这是一个新的保护机制，由SAMSAM船员添加在最近的SAMSAM版本由MalBigByter研究人员发现。OT具有这个机制，意味着任何发现SAMSAM二进制的人都可以通过双击和运行文件来感染他的计算机。但是添加这个密码保护系统与最终用户无关。SamSam ransomware是一个只在R上部署它的组的创建。通常是在侵入大型公司或政府机构的私人网络之后的场合。勒索软件不是在垃圾邮件或网页上发现的东西。密码被添加以防止安全研究人员执行RANSOWS二进制文件，以防他们偶然发现一个工作版本，并限制他们可以收集关于SamSam L的信息。研究人员说，这是SAMSRAM勒索的新添加物，一种在过去一年中缓慢进化的毒株。证据来自最近的网络安全公司的报告，这些报告还分析了勒索软件，但密码保护系统不到位。例如，“该密码似乎是在编译时设置的”，这意味着每个活动可能有不同的密码关联。“有了它，”Allan Liska，资深解决方案架构师在未来的记录，告诉哔哔哔哔的计算机。“但是，据我们所知，SamSam集团不是一个民族国家的演员，这些策略，保护代码从安全研究人员和限制您的工具的曝光，是非常相似的。利斯卡说：“对于哪些国家的国家演员来说，”其他的勒索毒株更为普遍，这是大规模的马斯巴姆和基于开发工具包的分发工作的主题，例如达摩、Grimimimor或SARAB，SamSam ransomware是当今最著名和最著名的毒株。使用SamSam背后的团队在2018的第一季度非常活跃，击中了无数的目标，比如SAMSAM，当它在世界范围内臭名昭著的时候。
New versions of the SamSam ransomware will not execute unless the person running the malware's payload enters a special password via the command-line.This is a new protection mechanism added by the SamSam crew in a recent SamSam version discovered by Malwarebytes researchers.Previous versions did not feature this mechanism, meaning anyone who found a SamSam binary could have infected his computer by double-clicking and running the file.But the addition of this password-protection system has nothing to do with end users.The SamSam ransomware is the creation of a group who deploys it only on rare occasions, usually after hacking into the private networks of large companies or government institutions. The ransomware is not something someone finds in spam emails or lying around the web.The password has been added to prevent security researchers from executing the ransomware binary, in case they stumble upon a working version, and limit what kind of information they can gather about the SamSam's latest version.Researchers say this is a new addition to the SamSam ransomware, a strain that has slowly evolved in the past year. Proof stands recent reports from fellow cyber-security firms that have also analyzed the ransomware, but where the password-protection system was not in place.For example, reports from "That password appears to be set at compile time, which means each campaign may have a different password associated with it," Allan Liska, Senior Solutions Architect at Recorded Future, told Bleeping Computer."While, to the best of our knowledge, the SamSam group is not a nation state actor, these tactics, protecting the code from security researchers and limiting the exposure of your tools, are very similar to what nation state actors do," Liska added.While other ransomware strains are more widespread, being the subject of massive malspam and exploit kit-based distribution efforts, such as Dharma, GlobeImpostor, or Scarab, the SamSam ransomware is today's most famous and well-known strain.This is because the group behind SamSam has been quite active in the first quarter of 2018, hitting countless of targets such as SamSam garnered worldwide notoriety when it
