As Kim Jong-un Experts from several cybersecurity firms Â Dell SecureWorks, McAfee, Symantec, FireEye and Recorded Future Â all told CyberScoop that activity from North Korea has stayed steady or grown in volume since peace talks gained steam earlier this year.The activities of these ÂSimilar to operations conducted prior to that date [circa January], North Korean actors have engaged in broad cyber espionage using a ÂWe have seen a heavy concentration of targeting in Southeast Asia and the United States, with some cross over into the Middle East,Â McAfee Senior Researcher Ryan Sherstobitoff said. ÂWe have even seen an entire countryÂs financial sector targeted by Hidden Cobra during this period.ÂHidden Cobra is one of the nicknames assigned by the U.S. government to North KoreaÂs hacking activities; other names authored by the private sector include ÂLazarus Group,Â ÂBlue NortoffÂ and ÂRed Eyes.ÂOn Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of InvestigationÂ ÂThe group continues to use implants The findings, shared with CyberScoop, provide a stark reminder that North Korea remains highly dependent on cybercrime for both financial and geopolitical gain, so much so in that theyÂre willing to risk angering foreign governments amid a diplomatic push.ÂDuring the past few months weÂve seen Lazarus conduct attacks on financial organizations, with the intention of attempting bank heists,Â saidÂ Vikram Thakur of SymantecÂs Security Response team. ÂThe volume of these attacks is not massive but the trend reflects a small uptick in overall attacks and attempts of financial fraud.ÂThe diplomatic talks regarding North Korea involve several key countries, including China, Russia, South Korea and the U.S.Â A number of research teams see the U.S. and South Korea still being targeted.ÂDuring the timeframe, North Korea had been focusing their attention to South Korean targets, specifically North Korean defectors and related organizations for intelligence gathering,Â a spokesperson for SecureWorksÂ Counter Threat Unit said. ÂBased on targeting select victims, it appears that the [North Korean] government is keen to acquire information that could affect current peace process Â We have not directly observed but are aware of phishing lures containing topics concerning current peace talks.ÂNorth KoreaÂs use of these diplomatically inspired phishing emails was not previously known.How the small, resource-strapped nation will move away from this type of behavior if it is to improve foreign partnerships is an open-ended question, experts say.The challenge is especially significant because ofÂ the decentralized nature of North KoreaÂs hacking units. Prior ÂDPRK cyber espionage operations continue to increase in scope and sophistication, developing new offensive capabilities and leveraging zero day vulnerabilities,Â saidÂ Cristiana Brafman Kittner, principal security analyst at FireEye.Â These financially motivated intrusions have continued during the run up to a potential Kim Â Trump summit.ÂOn Wednesday, top North Korean and U.S. government officials met in Singapore to discuss next steps in the negotiations, according The meeting was heldÂ New Jersey-based cybersecurity firm Comodo saw an increase following a meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Kim on May 9.Â Such detections could suggest one of two things: that the country is itself being hacked or that hackers inside North Korea are testing their own tools internally before operating abroad.A ComodoÂ employee provided CyberScoop with a company presentation that showed this activity:ÂComodo has security software (and thus malware detections) inside North Korea,Â said Kenneth Geers, chief scientist at Comodo.In early MaySouth KoreaÂs Financial Security Institute, a leading player in thwarting North Korean cyber aggression, did not respond to a request for comment.
