CrowdStrike is affording customers of its flagship cybersecurity service a free warranty to at least partially cover the cost of a breach should one occur on a system it’s protecting.CrowdStrike “Other industries have long offered product warranties to assure customers that the products they purchase will function as advertised. This has not been the case in cybersecurity, where customers generally have little recourse when security products fail to protect them,” the company said.Historically, even if an organization employs a reputable cybersecurity product to protect its systems, it generally has to bear the cost if it suffers a breach.CrowdStrike’s new warranty covers the company’s Falcon Endpoint Protection Complete customers for up to $1 million if a breach happens in the environment was hired to protect.
