国会众议院军事委员会每年通过数百项修正案来制定一项两党国防授权法案，从5月9日上午开始，持续到午夜。经过14个小时的辩论，委员会报告了7160亿美元的法案。排除248项修正案，有利的是60-1票。夏威夷民主党议员Tulsi-Gabbar是唯一的拥护者。在信息技术战线上，Anthony Brown议员（D.MD）试图反对委员会主席提议削减五角大楼的“第四产业”——提供后勤支持和服务的国防机构。Mac Thornberry主席（R -得克萨斯州）有Orgi。纳利希望消除国防信息系统局和华盛顿总部的服务。主席提出的法案要求将这些削减留给国防部首席管理官。布朗的修正案在2020年3月1日之前提出了国防部长、CMO、CIO等人的报告。布朗担心潜在失业的影响，他说：“目前还不清楚迪萨的任务和职能会发生什么。”Thornberry说，委员会“看那些不属于[服务]的机构”和他们不断增长的预算是很重要的。他说：“迪萨的支持率提高了13%，“我有一个更明确的规定，我希望看到这一切会如何发展。”Thornberry在反对修正案之前说，委员会拒绝采纳。一些委员会成员对拟议的25%次削减支持机构和职能表示关注。ONS包括IT、人事管理和物流。此外，Thornberry提出的消除测试资源管理中心的提案被否决了。一些旨在改善网络教育和增加网络防御的修正案通过了委员会。Salud Carbajal的（D-加利福尼亚）修正案批准了陆军国民警卫队的网络T。降雨试点方案通过。该措施将允许使用共同的标准对网络保护团队和网络网络防御团队进行并行训练。该计划还将整合警卫、执法人员和应急人员之间的训练。修正案将使陆军国民警卫队成员嵌入联邦政府和州政府部门和机构，以帮助促进政府间的合作网络防御。另一个由Jimmy Panetta议员（D-加利福尼亚州）所倡导的，将要求收购和维持副国务卿向委员会简要介绍扩大国防退役军队的黑客攻击的效果。RTMANS告诉FCW，该项目“应该是军队内部的运动”。2018国防部批准了国防部长1500万美元扩大国防攻势，但资金没有及时到位，纽厄尔说。今年，他希望拨款能扩大到更多的大学。HASC还通过了一项规定，允许国防部长在每个高级军事学院设立一个网络研究所，并在网络、数据科学和密码学方面提供证书和学位课程。S呼吁关于自动系统的网络安全风险报告、自动化网络防御能力的进步以及在攻击性网络操作中使用自主智能和机器学习。关于AuthorPrior加入FCW，威廉姆斯是TimePrime'的技术记者，在那里她涵盖了从互联网文化到国家安全问题的一切。在过去的职位，威廉姆斯涵盖医疗保健，政治和犯罪的各种出版物，包括《西雅图时报》。威廉姆斯毕业于马里兰大学新闻学院、大学公园和德拉瓦大学的营养学学士。她可以在我们的新闻发布会上联系。TTI同意这个网站的
CongressThe House Armed Services Committee conducted its annual slog through hundreds of amendments to come up with a bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act starting in the morning of May 9 and continuing past midnight.After 14 hours of debate, the committee reported the $716 billion bill, including 248 amendments, favorably on a 60-1 vote. Hawaii Democrat Tulsi Gabbard was the lone holdout.On the IT front, Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.) looked to counter the committee chairman's proposal to trim the Pentagon's "fourth estate" -- the defense agencies that provide back office support and services.Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) had originally looked to eliminate the Defense Information Systems Agency and the Washington Headquarters Service. The bill proposed by the chairman called for leaving such cuts up to the Department of Defense chief management officer.Brown's amendment proposed a report from the secretary of defense, the CMO, CIO and others by March 1, 2020 in advance of any consolidation. Brown, concerned with the impact of the potential job loss, said "It remains unclear what would happen to DISA's missions and functions."Thornberry said it is "important" for the committee "to take a look at those [DOD] agencies that aren't a part of the [services]," and their growing budgets. DISA's is up 13 percent, he said."I'm a little more prescriptive in that I want to [see] how will this go," Thornberry said before opposing the amendment, which the committee declined to adopt.Some committee members expressed concern about a proposed 25 percent cut to supporting agencies and functions including IT, personnel management and logistics. Additionally, a proposal by Thornberry to eliminate the Test Resource Management Center was voted down.Several amendments aimed at improving cyber education and increasing cyber defenses sailed through committee.Rep. Salud Carbajal's (D-Calif.) amendment to approve the Army National Guard's cyber training pilot program passed. The measure would allow concurrent training of cyber protection teams and cyber network defense teams using a common standard. The program would also integrate training between the guard, law enforcement and emergency personnel.The amendment would have Army National Guard members embedded with federal and state government departments and agencies to help facilitate cooperative cyber defenses across the government, making training more cohesive and efficient.Another, championed by Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.) would require the acquisition and sustainment undersecretary to brief the committee on the effect of expanding the Hacking for Defense Retired Army Col. Peter Newell, managing partner of consulting firm BMNT Partners told FCW ahead of the markup that the program "should be an intramural sport in the Army."The 2018 NDAA approved $15 million for the defense secretary to expand Hacking for Defense but the funds weren't appropriated in time, Newell said. This year, he hopes the funding is there to expand its role to more universities.The HASC also passed a provision allowing the defense secretary to put a cyber institute at each senior military college and offer certificates and degree programs in cyber, data science, and cryptography.Other measures called for reports on cybersecurity risks to autonomous systems, progress on automated cyber defense capabilities and the use of autonomous intelligence and machine learning in offensive cyber operations.About the AuthorPrior to joining FCW, Williams was the tech reporter for ThinkProgress, where she covered everything from internet culture to national security issues.
