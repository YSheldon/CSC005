tttWhether visiting a mom n pop shop on Main Street or a luxury store on Fifth Avenuecustomers will come in asking for relevant, personalized experiences. Customers expect retailers to engage them in a highly tailored and consistent manner across both physical and digital channels. Thats where in-store Wi-Fi comes in.
