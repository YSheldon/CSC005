微软的Windows防御者在15个反病毒（AV）产品中排名第七，在一个独立的测试。但是，结果并不能说明整个情况，微软认为。随着Windows 10的内置Windows防御程序反病毒的改进，一些用户根据Windows 10的顶级AV产品，在保护、性能和可用性方面对Windows防护程序进行了高度的保护，检测了100%个新的和旧的恶意软件，但是丢失了性能，它测量AV减慢应用程序和网站的多少；以及可用性，它计数假阳性或AV错误地将文件标识为恶意的实例。Windows防御程序的性能评级被拖累了，因为它经常使用的应用程序的安装速度超过行业平均水平，错误地检测出16个合法软件，而行业平均水平为四。但微软希望企业客户知道Windows Debug只有一半的图片，考虑到客户还可以部署Windows防御软件高级威胁保护（ATP）“堆栈组件”，包括StaskSuffor、应用程序保护和应用程序控制。一月和二月测试窗口卫冕者也获得了100%的保护。然而，它错过了两个样本。从那时起，它的机器学习分类器重新检测它们。但微软注意到，“随着威胁变得越来越复杂，微软和其他安全平台供应商继续开发他们的产品能力，以检测不同攻击阶段的威胁，”微软Windows防御研究小组写道。我们希望看到独立的测试者也进化他们的方法。我们的客户需要更大的透明度和光学性，使端到端解决方案能够在全面的预防性保护方面实现，包括像防病毒这样的单个组件的质量。微软高度致力于与多个独立的测试人员合作，开发安全测试，专注于端到端的安全堆栈测试。根据一月二月的测试，Windows Debug仍然存在错误地将合法应用程序分类为恶意软件的问题。然而，微软争辩说，所有21个错误分类的应用程序要么是媒体播放器，要么是音频混合器，这在企业环境中并不常见。它还认为，在合成测试中的假阳性并不影响微软在现实世界中使用的上下文信息，它阻止了防御者错误地将干净的应用程序标记为坏。Windows Fuidor仍然比安装频率的行业平均要慢得多。广泛使用的应用程序。然而，微软再次反驳说，企业用户通常花费更少的时间安装新的应用程序，更多的时间使用浏览器、电子邮件和文字处理器。Windows 10的安全性不会保护你免受技术支持骗子的欺骗和欺骗。只需扫描一个特别精心制作的文件就可能导致T。OTA妥协Windows机器。微软将继续其即将到来的Windows 10发布与快速环内幕构建17120，因为它走向终点线。微软正在添加Windows 7 SP1和Windows 8.1到受保护的端点由Windows防御程序ATP，开始微软是一个新的Windows 10安全功能，保证启动和运行后的系统完整性。
Microsoft's Windows Defender ranks seventh out of 15 antivirus (AV) products in an independent test. But the results don't tell the whole picture, argues Microsoft. With improvements to Windows 10's built-in Windows Defender antivirus, some users are But according to the The top AV products for Windows 10 across protection, performance, and usability Windows Defender rated highly on protection, detecting 100 percent of new and old malware, but lost points for performance, which measures how much an AV slows applications and websites; and usability, which counts false-positives or instances where AV wrongly identifies a file as malicious. Windows Defender's performance rating was dragged down because it slowed the installation of frequently used applications more than the industry average, and wrongly detected 16 pieces of legitimate software compared with the industry average of four. But Microsoft wants enterprise customers to know that Windows Defender is only half the picture, given the option for customers to also deploy Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection's (ATP) "stack components" including Smartscreen, Application Guard, and Application Control.In the January and February test Windows Defender also scored 100 percent on protection. However it did miss two samples. Since then it's retrained its machine-learning classifiers to detect them. But Microsoft notes in a "As threats become more sophisticated, Microsoft and other security platform vendors continue evolving their product capabilities to detect threats across different attack stages," Microsoft's Windows Defender Research team writes. "We hope to see independent testers evolve their methodologies as well. Our customers need greater transparency and optics into what an end-to-end solution can accomplish in terms of total preventive protection, including the quality of individual components like antivirus. "Microsoft is highly engaged in working with several independent testers to evolve security testing to focus on end-to-end security stack testing." Windows Defender still has problems with incorrectly classifying legitimate apps as malware, according to the January-February test. However, Microsoft contends that all 21 of the misclassified apps were either media players or audio mixers, which aren't common in enterprise environments. It also argues that the false-positives in the synthetic test don't factor in contextual information Microsoft uses in the real-world machines that prevent Defender from wrongly flagging clean apps as bad.And Windows Defender still significantly slower than the industry average for installing frequently used applications. However, again Microsoft counters that enterprise users generally spend less time installing new apps and more time using browsers, email, and word processors.Windows 10 security won't protect you from tech-support scammers' lies and trickery.Just scanning a specially-crafted file could lead to a totally compromised Windows machine.Microsoft is continuing to polish its coming Windows 10 release with Fast Ring Insider Build 17120 as it heads toward the finish line.Microsoft is adding Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1 to the list of protected end-points covered by Windows Defender ATP, starting this summer.Microsoft preps new Windows 10 security features to ensure system integrity during start-up and after it's running.
