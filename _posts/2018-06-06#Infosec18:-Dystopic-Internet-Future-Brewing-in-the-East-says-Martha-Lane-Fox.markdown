Although 50% of respondents to a recent poll conducted by her new company Key to the UK’s resilience in a post-Brexit world will be its ability not just to grow the digital economy, but to “flip the switch” and build a society enabled by technology – driving improvements in schools, transport, local government and more.“We don’t have any option [post-Brexit] but to become the most modern digital nation we can be,” said Lane Fox.However, in order to do so, the UK will have to tackle a profound technical skills deficit, she added.
