Security researcher Paul Moore has made his objection to this practice  in which the British bank is not alone  clear, even though it is done for good reasons. The researcher claimed that performing port scans on visitors without permission is a violation of the UK's Halifax has disputed this, arguing that the port scans help it pick up evidence of malware infections on customers' systems. The scans are legal, Halifax If security researchers operate in a similar fashion, we almost always run into the Computer Misuse Act, even if their intent isn't malicious. The CMA should be applied fairly...When you visit the Halifax login page, even before you've logged in, JavaScript on the site, running in the browser, attempts to scan for open ports on your local computer to see if remote desktop or VNC services are running, and looks for some general remote access trojans (RATs)  backdoors, in other words. Crooks are known to abuse these remote services to snoop on victims' banking sessions.Moore said he wouldn't have an issue if Halifax carried out the security checks on people's computers According to Moore, when he called Halifax to complain, a representative told him: "We have to port scan your machine for security reasons."Having failed to either persuade Halifax Bank to change its practices or Action Fraud to act (thus farHalifax Bank's "unauthorised" port scans are a clear violation of the CMA  and amounts to an action that security researchers are frequently criticised and/or convicted for, Moore argued. The CISO and part-time security researcher hopes his efforts in this matter might result in a clarification of the law."Ultimately, we can't have it both ways," Moore told The whole effort might smack of tilting at windmills, but Moore said he was acting on a point of principle."If security researchers operate in a similar fashion, we almost always run into the CMA, even if their intent isn't malicious. The CMA should be applied fairly to both parties."Moore announced his findings, his crowdfunded litigation push and the reasons behind it on Twitter, sparking a The scanning happens on the customer login page and not the main Halifax Bank site, others were quick to Infosec pro Lee Burgess Surely there needs to be intent to cause harm or recklessness for any criminal violation, neither of which is present in the case of Halifax, UK security pro Kevin Beaumont Moore Moore Halifax Bank is part of Lloyds Banking Group, and a The scripts run within the visitor's browser, and are required to check if a machine is infected with malware. They test for this by trying to connect to a local port, but this is illegal without consent, according to Moore."Whilst their intentions are clear and understandable, the simple act of scanning and actively trying to connect to several ports, without consent, is a clear violation of the CMA," Moore argued.Beaumont Moore responded that even passively listening would break the CMA. "That's sufficient to breach CMA. If I port-sweep Halifax to see what's listening, I'd be breaching CMA too," he The same ThreatMetrix tech is used by multiple UK high street banks, Moore went on to say that this testing  however well-intentioned  might have undesirable consequences."Halifax/Lloyds Banking Group are not trying to gain remote access to your device; they are merely testing to see if such a connection is possible and if the port responds. There is no immediate threat to your security or money," he explained."The results of their unauthorised scan are sent back to Halifax and processed in a manner which is unclear. If you happen to allow remote desktop connections or VNC, someone (other than you) will be notified as such. If those applications have vulnerabilities of which you are unaware, you are potentially at greater risk."Moore expressed that his arguably quixotic actions may have beneficial effects. "Either Halifax [is] forced to correct it and pays researchers from the proceeds, or the CMA is revised to clarify that if [its] true intent isn't malicious, [it's] safe to continue," he We have asked ThreatMetrix for comment. ŽHalifax Bank has been to touch to say: "Keeping our customers safe is of paramount importance to the Group and we have a range of robust processes in place ?to protect online banking customers."
