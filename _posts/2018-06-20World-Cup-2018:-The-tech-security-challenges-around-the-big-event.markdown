世界上最大的体育赛事之一已经达到了形式，而世界杯等事件被许多人视为享受体育戏剧的机会，一些人将高调的事件视为进行间谍活动和黑客活动的机会。今年韩国冬奥会已经吸引了黑客的兴趣。被称为“奥运毁灭者”的恶意软件被设计成破坏性的，但它也被设计成迷惑，留下了暗示北朝鲜黑客的踪迹。虽然有人指责俄罗斯袭击，但主要的体育和文化事件对那些想制造高调网络事件的团体来说是诱人的目标。“当然，在高调的事件中，如果一个威胁性的演员想要引起破坏，我们可以通过观察行动来了解。NS的恶意软件，如奥运会驱逐舰，他们有能力，“Martin Lee，技术领先的思科塔洛斯告诉ZDNET。”通常不清楚谁在特定的攻击背后或他们的目标是什么，现在分析威胁变得越来越困难的威胁演员试图积极地混浊水域“，但”总是有一个网络元素对所有这些大事件，无论是世界杯或奥运会。“有这么多国家参与和政治后果，总是有一个信息收集元素，”CuldJead首席执行官George Kurtz告诉ZDNET，“他们将亲自收集信息，他们将通过传统方法收集信息，他们是GOI。NG通过网络组件收集信息。有很多国家都在收集信息，而不仅仅是一个。“然而，世界杯正在俄罗斯举行，在潜在的民族国家黑客攻击中创造了一种不寻常的动力。上周，美国情报官员警告旅行者参加世界杯。他们的智能手机或笔记本电脑可能是俄罗斯黑客或网络犯罪分子的目标。“公司和政府官员最有风险，但不要认为你太渺小，不能成为目标。”联邦调查局特工William Evanina和美国国家反情报局局长。安全中心：“我们所属的一些国家，比如俄罗斯，可能正在重组他们的目标清单，因为他们现在在国内有战略目标，而不是在不同的国家和政府的大楼里，”Jens Monrad，首席情报分析家。在FireEye的安全公司告诉ZDNET。安全公司EngPoice首席社交科学家Andrea Little Limbago告诉ZDNET，可能是在俄罗斯的目标之一是外国媒体。不过，她补充说，欺骗因素可能会在这里发挥作用，其他国家试图制造攻击企图转移责任。“这并不意味着其他人不会，或者其他组织不会伪装成俄罗斯。”这是我们所看到的趋势之一，伪装和欺骗正在进行，这只是在前进。“但是，虽然民族国家可能会把俄罗斯作为一个竞技场来进行国际地缘政治的盛大游戏，但他们不会是唯一想要炫耀他们的人。肌肉——一些网络犯罪团伙也可以从中获利。“但事实上，我们也看到像俄罗斯这样的国家受到有组织犯罪的严重影响，这是历史上针对他们的。Monrad说：“这些群体的升级也可能是因为他们有一个全球观众，”游客们可能带来的设备或电脑设备更容易妥协，因为他们在一个活动中，他们正在降低他们的防守杆。“Monrad说。
One of the biggest sporting events in the world has arrived in the form of While events like the World Cup are viewed by many as an opportunity to enjoy sporting drama, there are some who see high-profile events such as this as an opportunity to conduct espionage and hacking campaigns.For example, one high-profile sports event to already attract the interest of hackers this year was the Winter Olympics in South Korea. Dubbed Olympic Destroyer, the malware was designed to be destructive,but it was also designed to confuse, with a trail left implicating North Korean hackers. And while some have blamed Russia for the attack it's Major sporting and cultural events like this are tempting targets for groups looking to create high-profile cyber incidents."Certainly, with high-profile events, if a threat actor has a desire to cause disruption, we know by looking at the actions of malware such as Olympic Destroyer that they have the capability," Martin Lee, technical lead at Cisco Talos told ZDNet. "Often it's not clear who is behind particular attacks or what their objectives are and now that analysis is becoming more difficult by threat actors attempting to actively muddy the waters".But while "There's always a cyber element to all these big events, whether it's the World Cup or the Olympics. Just with so many countries involved and the political ramifications, there's always an information gathering element to it," George Kurtz, CEO of Crowdstrike told ZDNet."They're going to gather information in person, they're going to gather information through traditional methods and they're going to gather information through a cyber component. There's going to be a lot of countries involved in gathering information, not just one."Still, that the World Cup is taking place in Russia creates something of an unusual dynamic when it comes to potential nation-state hacking.Last week a US intelligence official warned travellers to the World Cup that their smartphones or laptops could be targeted by Russian hackers or cyber criminals."Corporate and government officials are most at risk, but don't assume you're too insignificant to be targeted," William Evanina, an FBI agent and the director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center "Some of those groups we attribute to nations like Russia may be restructuring their target list because they now have strategic targets that are in the country rather than having them abroad in different countries and government buildings," Jens Monrad, principal intelligence analyst at security company FireEye told ZDNet.Andrea Little Limbago, chief social scientist at security firm Endgame told ZDNet that one group that might be targeted while in Russia would be the foreign media. However, she added that the deception element could come into play here, with other nations attempting to make attacks trying to shift the blame."That doesn't mean that other folks won't, or that other groups won't masquerade as Russia. That's one of the trends we're seeing, the masquerading and deception that's going on and that's only going to advance".But while nation-states may end up using Russia as an arena for playing the grand game of international geopolitics, they're not going to be the only players looking to flex their muscles -- some cyber criminal groups could look to cash in, too."But we do in fact also see countries like Russia being heavily impacted by organised crime which has historically targeted them. There could also be an escalation in these groups which are motivated because they have a global audience," said Monrad."Maybe visitors are bringing devices or computer equipment that's easier to compromise because they're at an event and they're lowering their defensive bars," Monrad said.
