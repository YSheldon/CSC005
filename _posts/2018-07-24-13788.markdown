Patches have already been released or are expected to see the light of day soontttttttttttttttResearchers have discovered a flaw in some Bluetooth implementations that could allow an attacker to intercept or tamper with data exchanged between two vulnerable devices.The cryptographic bug, tracked as The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), which is the governing body behind the Bluetooth standard, To be sure, such a check is not required, but only recommended by the Bluetooth specification. Or, rather, it The US CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) released additional In some implementations, the elliptic curve parameters are not all validated by the cryptographic algorithm implementation, which may allow a remote attacker within wireless range to inject an invalid public key to determine the session key with high probability. Such an attacker can then passively intercept and decrypt all device messages, and/or forge and inject malicious messages, according to CERT/CC.Software and Apple, Broadcom, and Intel have all confirmed the flaw, and the first two have already released patches. Qualcomms chipsets are also listed as affected in CERT/CCs advisory, while the implications for Android, Google, and Linux kernel vis-ŕ-vis the vulnerability have yet to be determined. Windows is in the clear.As per SIG, the bug is not known to have been exploited in the wild. Either way, such a man-in-the-middle attack would require the perpetrator to place themselves within the range of both targeted Bluetooth-enabled devices that are going through the pairing procedure. In addition, both devices need to be vulnerable for the attack to succeed.Arguably, the easiest countermeasure is turning Bluetooth off whenever youre not using it.tttttttttttttttttttttttttt
