The Mozilla Foundation, the organization behind the Firefox browser, is working on adding a new feature to its browser that is similar to the Site Isolation feature that Google rolled out to Chrome users this year.For readers who haven't been keeping up with the latest Chrome features, Chrome does this to isolate code from different sites in different processes, hence, creating a harder-to-penetrate security boundary between websites, and preventing malicious from one site from accessing data from other sites.Google added Site Isolation Google accelerated its Site Isolation release plans when details about the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities became public. From an experimental project that had been in the works for several months, Site Isolation became Chrome's primary defense against Meltdown and Spectre attacks and immediately entered an accelerated rollout plan.This plan finished at the end of May when Google released But Chrome won't be the only browser with Site Isolation. Work on a similar feature also began at Mozilla headquarters back in April, in a plan dubbed According to Mozilla sources who spoke with Bleeping Computer, this project is still in its early stages. We were told that implementing a per-domain-process architecture is a relatively simple task, especially after Mozilla has already rolled out Electrolysis, a project that split Firefox from a single-process app to a multi-process architecture.Currently, Firefox works by creating one GUI (graphical user interface) process and multiple page rendering processes. Firefox is still tethered to a maximum number of rendering processes it can create, but that multi-process architecture is already in place.This limit of maximum rendering process has been established because as Firefox creates more processes, those processes also start to hog a PC's memory, driving up RAM use.Switching to a per-domain/site process architecture should be relatively easy, at the technical level, but the main hurdle remains RAM performance.This month, Mozilla engineers have started work on improving this performance. On July 10, Mozilla announced the start of Fission MemShrink, a sub-project of Project Fission, during which Mozilla engineers plan to improve Firefox's RAM use. We cite from a Mozilla mailing list on the subject:Firefox users can track advances on Fission MemShrink on this The advantages of a Fission (Site Isolation) feature are just too good to ignore. There is no deadline or even guarantee that Fission MemShrink will succeed, but we at least know that Mozilla cares enough to at least try.Firefox has often been labeled a memory hog in the past. Even if Mozilla engineers don't manage to shave off 7MB of memory use per process to make Fission MemShrink succeed, what they do manage to shave off will most likely be implemented in Firefox as is.
