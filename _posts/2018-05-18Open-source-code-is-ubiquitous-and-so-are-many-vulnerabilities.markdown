One-third of audited codebases that contain Apache Struts suffer from the same vulnerability that facilitated the Equifax hack a year agotttttttttttttttOpen source code is ubiquitous both in commercial and internal software applications, but security management is not keeping up, a recent study has found.Based on an analysis of data of more than 1,100 commercial codebases audited in 2017, the authors of the The percentage of open source components in the codebases of audited applications increased from 36% to 57% between the 2017 and 2018 reports. “Many applications now contain more open source than proprietary code,” reads the report. Each codebase contained an average of 257 open source components – an increase of 75% from the report’s previous edition.Worryingly, Credit: OSSRA, synopsys.comWhat is more, 17% of the codebases included in the OSSRA report contained at least one well-known vulnerability such as  Remember the Of nine industries included in the report, the highest proportions of codebases with high security risks were detected in the applications of internet and software infrastructure (67%), internet and mobile apps (60%), and virtual reality, gaming, entertainment and media (50%).As noted by OSSRA, almost 5,000 open source vulnerabilities were discovered in 2017, bringing their total to nearly 40,000 since 2000. Their number is, in fact, part of a larger trend, as last year saw an all-time high for vulnerabilities in open source and proprietary code combined. The number of reported flaws
