维多利亚州政府在星期四公布的一项报告中宣布了对该州道路安全摄像机的检修，该报告是在道路安全摄像机专员John Voyage的报告之后，对该网络的治理和安全协议进行了彻底检查。国家警察说，对于警察Lisa Neville来说，所有的建议都将被接受并“完全实施”。根据航行，病毒并没有影响到网络的“完整性”。我们的道路安全摄像机网络是保护维多利亚时代道路上的生命的组成部分。这就是为什么我们正在彻底检查其安全协议，以确保我们有最强的保护到位，”内维尔星期四的一份声明说，“该网络阻止危险驾驶，减少道路创伤，因此维多利亚时代的人对其完整性有信心。”已经证实WANACRY病毒对网络没有影响。我们不仅采取行动加强网络的网络安全，而且还加强我们的管理操作，以保护其免受任何未来威胁。“报告的建议的实施将由一个新的部门领导，以推动新的领导下的改革。一位新的道路安全摄像机计划主任也被任命来监督网络重新配置的设计和交付，并管理网络的持续运行，警察部长说，在感染时，内维尔透露了5条。5个最初的相机已经感染了一个流氓USB插入的人进行维修。这一数字最终增长到159以上。最初发现被感染的速度和红光相机是由车辆监控和执行服务Redflix操作的，但是不久之后，内维尔说调查发现额外的受影响的相机是由Jenoptik操作的，并指出了COMPA。纽约州没有将信息转交给当局。维多利亚州政府在发现感染后迅速行动起来，七月的临时报告说，由于WANACRRY感染的结果，54000份罚款中的绝大部分仍将保留，航程毫不含糊。他星期四说，政府已经采取了早期行动，“改进网络安全协议，收紧网络，防止摄像机从各个机器中引入病毒”。“道路安全摄像机拯救了我们道路上的生命。”新的管理结构、新政策和新的安全协议将确保维多利亚时代的人能够完全信任道路安全摄像机网络的完整性及其在促进政府对零道路安全运动至关重要的作用。道路安全摄像机程序的其他变化将包括安全性的加强，使得外部病毒不能在网络内传播，并在承建商和其他各方之间建立一个参考组，其目的是“加强”摄像机网络并捕捉问题。在此之前，会检讨道路安全摄影机专员的权力，以改善资讯共享。T.Realo3AW透露了一份速度相机专员的报告，说大部分的罚金在感染后恢复。对于一个有着文化基础的国家，检查点说澳大利亚正在认真对待网络安全的威胁。TWN引起全世界的混乱。但是它吸取了教训吗？T型软件攻击继续对全球企业造成严重破坏。以下是普华永道的六项建议，以预防和减轻这些网络犯罪。NHS的员工只有20个安全专业人员，WANACRY的财务影响还没有确定。
The Victorian government has announced an overhaul of the state's road safety cameras after the The announcement on Thursday sees an overhaul of the network's governance and security protocols, following a report from Road Safety Camera Commissioner John Voyage.The report, commissioned by Minister for Police Lisa Neville, and all of its recommendations will be accepted and "fully implemented", the state government said.According to Voyage, the virus did not affect the network's "integrity". "Our road safety camera network is integral to protecting the lives of Victorians on the road. That's why we're overhauling its security protocols to make sure we have the strongest protection in place," a statement from Neville said on Thursday."The network deters dangerous driving and reduces road trauma, so it's crucial Victorians have faith in its integrity."The independent commissioner has confirmed the WannaCry virus had no impact on the network. We're not only taking action to strengthen the network's cybersecurity, but also our management operations so that it is protected against any future threats."The implementation of the report's recommendations will be led by a new division created to drive the reforms, under new leadership that will report directly to Neville.A new director of the Road Safety Camera Program has also been appointed to oversee the design and delivery of the network's reconfiguration, and manage the ongoing operations of the network, the police minister said.At the time of infection, Neville revealed that the 55 initial cameras had been infected after a rogue USB was inserted by someone performing maintenance. That number eventually grew to over 159.The speed and red-light cameras initially found to be infected were operated by vehicle monitoring and enforcement service Redflix, but shortly after, Neville said investigations found additional impacted cameras were operated by Jenoptik, and noted the company did not forward the information on to authorities.Upon finding the infection, the Victorian government was quick to act, The interim report from the commissioner in July said the majority of the 54,000 fines pulled as a result of the WannaCry infection would still stand, with Voyage unequivocal that he The government said on Thursday that it has already taken early actions to "improve the cybersecurity protocols to tighten the network so cameras are protected against the introduction of viruses from individual machines"."Road safety cameras save lives on our roads. The new management structure, new policies, and new security protocols will ensure Victorians can continue to have complete confidence in the integrity of the road safety camera network and the role it plays in contributing to the government's vital Towards Zero road safety campaign," the statement continued.Other changes to the Road Safety Camera Program will include the tightening of security so external viruses cannot spread within the network, and the establishment of a reference group between contractors and other parties that will aim to "strengthen" the camera network and catch issues before they occur.A review of the powers of the Road Safety Camera Commissioner to improve information sharing will also be conducted. t tRadio 3AW has revealed a report from the Speed Camera Commissioner says the majority of the fines pulled after infection will be reinstated. t tFor a country with a culture based on taking things as they come, Check Point has said Australia is taking the threat of cybersecurity seriously. t tWannaCry caused chaos across the world. But have its lessons been learned? t tRansomware attacks continue to wreak havoc on businesses worldwide. Here are six recommendations from PwC to prevent and mitigate these cybercrimes. t tThe NHS has only 20 security professionals on staff, and the financial impact of WannaCry has not yet been determined.
