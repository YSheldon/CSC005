Here's everything else that happened in infosec land this week beyond what Chipmaker TSMC  which supplies components for Apple, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and others  said its semiconductor fab tools were downed by a virus.The malware hit the Taiwanese manufacturing giant's systems on Friday night, and some plants remain infected at time of writing while others have been restored to operation. It is not believed to be the result of an intrusion by one or more hackers  it sounds as though a staffer accidentally ran some kind of software nasty, and pwned computers on the network."Certain factories returned to normal in a short period of time, and we expect the others will return to normal in one day," the biz Remember the 70,000-odd A researcher has detailed a bug in the Linux kernel that can be exploited to leak sensitive data  such as cryptographic keys and passwords  from protected kernel memory, much in the same way as the Andrey Konovalov spelled out the situation to the "This allows to access kernel memory and leak keys, credentials or other sensitive information that is stored there (so the bug has a similar impact to Meltdown)," Konovalov explained.The flaw is present in kernels version pre-4.14.8, and was fixed in version 4.15-rc4 in late December. The patch has since been backdated to the version 4.4 stable branch. Make sure you're not running a vulnerable build as Konovalov said he will be releasing a proof-of-concept exploit some time next week.Essentially, although the vulnerability has been known about for eight months, a CVE was only assigned late last month, and some Linux distributions are still shipping vulnerable kernels. Canonical, at least, pulled in the patch in Ubuntu 16.04."In this particular case of a somewhat 'scary' bug there was a window of 3.5 months between the bug being reported and the fixing commit reaching the Ubuntu Xenial 4.4 kernel branch," Konovalov noted."This gives some insight into how much time it usually takes for a fix to travel from upstream through stable into a distro kernel when there's no CVE. Compared to the 14 days that distros are usually given to fix a security bug reported through linux-distros@, that seems rather long."Long known as America's hub for autos, Michigan is once again looking to get to the forefront of the industry, this time through security.Governor Rick Snyder has Dubbed "Masters of Mobility: Cyber Security on the Road," the new education push will aim to train teachers who will in turn lead classes on the basics of cybersecurity and software development for automobiles. The aim is to help the state regain its clout in the industry by offering a bumper crop of security research talent that specializes in the automotive field.The program will begin as a pilot with two Michigan schools in the Fall and, if successful, will roll out to nine more schools next year.The US Department of Homeland Security is stepping up its efforts to better manage the various IT security projects being undertaken by its various agencies. Earlier this week, the DHS The cybersecurity nerve center will also set the priorities for securing critical government functions and help sync up joint efforts between agencies and the private business sector."The National Risk Management Center advances the ongoing work of DHS and government and private sector partners to move collaborative efforts beyond information sharing and develop a common understanding of risk and joint action plans to ensure our nations most critical services and functions continue uninterrupted in a constantly evolving threat environment," the DHS said of the new program."The Center will work closely with the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), which will remain DHSs central hub for cyber operations focused on threat indicator sharing, technical analysis and assessment services, and incident response."Piriform, the developer of bloatware-cleaning tool CCleaner, is on the defensive after users spotted the version 5.45 of the app monitoring their activity without consent. Netizens noted that even when they turned off As it turns out, Active Monitoring itself is switched off when you disabled it, but that doesn't stop other telemetry from being beamed back to base.The The US government's Rogue userspace programs can crash guest kernels on 64-bit x86 PV Linux systems using Piriform said that even when its Active Monitoring tool is turned off, it will "The information which is collected through these new features is aggregated, anonymous data and only allows us to spot trends," Piriform explained. "This is very helpful to us for the purposes of improving our software and our customers experience. No personally identifiable information is collected."Piriform said it will be updating the tool soon to highlight exactly what is gobbled up when Active Monitoring is switched on and off  and As if retail giants' IT departments didn't have enough security issues to worry about, now there is the threat of BGP and DNS hijackings.Researchers This resulted in an extended outage of the payment systems on July 10 as the traffic was instead run through the attacker-controlled networks in the Ukraine. According to Oracle researcher Doug Madory, this is probably the sort of thing we will all have to get used to."If previous hijacks were shots across the bow, these incidents show the Internet infrastructure is now taking direct hits," Madory wrote. "Unfortunately, there is no reason not to expect to see more of these types of attacks against the internet."Free-HTTPS-cert-issuing org "The upstream provider beyond Namecheap accidentally set the status of our domain to clientHold," the project's Josh Aas told us. "Seems like it was some sort of administrative error. We're looking into steps we can take to reduce the likelihood of something like this happening again." Ž
