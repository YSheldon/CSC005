It seems Â Hacker Fantastic (@hackerfantastic) While Apple strives to make their iPhones harder and harder to breach, a security researcher published a brute-force vulnerabilityÂ for iOS devices that he saidÂ cracked the security measures built into the system. However, AppleÂ denied the researcherÂs findings and the researcher acknowledged an error.ResearcherÂ By Saturday, after a slew of security experts inside and outside of Apple got involved, Hickey corrected the record. His full explanation of the error is below:ÂItÂs basically a feature of the devices,Â he explained. ÂIf you send pin codes too quickly or send lots of duplicate entries, the devices donÂt actually test the pin codes Â they appear to on the user interface but under the hood it never uses the pin. So it appears you send 20 or more pins to a device for instance, but in reality, it has only processed 3 or 4 of those pins.ÂÂI still believe that the advice should be to all consumers to use a seven-digit or more pin code or complex password, as there is still unknown attacks from GrayKey which function in a similar manner.Â I was able to double check my work after speaking with Stefan Esser and Apple, it seems even though I was sending lots of PINs to the device, it only ever processed a small number of them due to this feature. ItÂs intended to stop people pocket dialing and wiping their phones.ÂThe issueÂ comes at a time when the debate over law enforcement unlocking iPhones is once again at a fever pitch. As a result of iOS 12Âs new security, companies like Cellebrite and Greyshift are working to make sure their core business Â cracking open phones for law enforcement Â stays intact.
