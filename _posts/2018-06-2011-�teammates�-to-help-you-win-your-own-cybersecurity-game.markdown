Our lineup may seem heavy on the defensive side, but such is the nature of game plans for warding off a range of threats lurking in cyberspacetttttttttttttttWe The year 2017 went down in history for many things, including two massive cyber-incidents – the Alas, this is not an ideal world and, truthfully, an operating system or even an application that is free from flaws is a pipe dream. However, in home settings, ensuring that automatic Time is of the essence, too, since the release of a patch may set off a race against the clock. Within days – if not hours – attackers can reverse-engineer the update, identify the vulnerability, then craft (or save all the effort and just buy) an True, this doesn’t address Fielding no-longer-needed software is tantamount to having a disgruntled bench-warmer who ends up sapping your team’s morale. Software that you hardly ever use or that has been supplanted by a “younger contender” can become a liability simply by increasing your attack surface. To further reduce the possible entry points for cybercriminals, you may also want to disable unnecessary and unused services and ports, and ditch programs that have a track record of vulnerabilities, especially of the zero-day nature.To harden your browser, consider blocking ads and removing all but the most necessary of browser add-ons and plugins. Many web-based attacks co-opt these features to foist malware on internet users. While you’re at it, shut down the accounts that you no longer need and use your high-privilege, or admin, account only for administrative tasks.One of the easiest ways to protect your online identities consists in using a long, strong and unique If you’re like most people and find the need to remember many username/password combinations overwhelming, consider using a password manager, which is intended to store your passwords in a “vault”. It can also create nigh onto impossible-to-guess passwords. Or you can also try Even if you have the most complex of passwords or passphrases, be mindful of where you input them.On the internet, everything is just a click away, and fraudsters are keenly aware of that. In their pursuit of your personal information, they use Much as with all sorts of tempting ads, While using a single data item, e.g. login credentials, to Whatever its implementation – although, preferably, we’d recommend that you use something When you connect to the internet, an attacker can sometimes place himself between your device and the connection point, especially over ubiquitous wireless connections. In order to greatly reduce the risk that such a man-in-the-middle attack will intercept your sensitive data while they are in motion, use only web connections secured by HTTPS (particularly for your most valued accounts) and use trusted networks such as your home connection or mobile data when performing the most sensitive of online operations, such as mobile banking. Needless to say, secure Wi-Fi connections should be underpinned by at least WPA2 encryption (or, ideally, Be very wary of public Wi-Fi hotspots. If you need to A staple in network security, a firewall is one of your key defensive players. Indeed, it is often thought of as the very first line of defense vis-à-vis the internet. It can typically be a piece of software in your computer, perhaps as part of anti-malware software, or it can be built into your router – or you can actually use both a network- and a host-based firewall. Regardless of its implementation, a firewall acts as a brawny bouncer that, based on predetermined rules, allows or denies traffic from the wild and woolly internet into an internal network or computer system.In fact, a firewall can block outbound traffic, too. In so doing, it can help mitigate the risk that, for example, your computer will connect to a A backup is the kind of player who doesn’t get much time on the pitch, but when he Your system cannot usually be too – or completely – safe from harm. Beyond a cyber-incident, your data could be compromised by something as unpredictable as a storage medium failure. A backup is an example of a measure that is corrective in nature, but that is fully dependent on how hard you “practiced”. Or, as Benjamin Franklin put it, “by failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail”. It will cost you some time and possibly money to create (time and time again) your backups, but when it comes to averting (data) loss, this player may very well Even if you use your common sense and take all kinds of “behavior-centered” precautions, you need another essential addition to your roster. At a time when you’re pitted against attackers who are ever more skilled, organized and persistent, dedicated security software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect your digital assets.A reliable anti-malware solution uses many and various detection techniques and deploys multiple layers of defense that kick in at different stages of the attack process. That way, you’re provided with multiple opportunities to stymie a threat, including the latest threats, as attackers constantly come up with new malicious tools. This underscores the importance of always downloading the latest updates to your anti-malware software, which ideally are released several times a day. Top-quality security software automates this process, so you needn’t worry about installing the updates.Much of this article’s guidance also applies to There’s a number of measures you can take to reduce risks associated with mobile devices. They include relying on a secure authentication method to A dedicated mobile security solution will also go a long way towards enhancing your protection from mobile threats. This includes a scenario whereby your device goes missing, so you are then able to use the suite’s anti-theft and remote-wipe functionalities.The final team member is, in fact, you – the keeper.
