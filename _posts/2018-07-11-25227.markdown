Several Internet transit providers 혰companies that route global Internet traffic between local ISPs, end users, and data centers혰 have banded together to ban a fellow transit provider that has carried out at least 130 Internet route (BGP) hijacks in the past few years, most of which, experts say, were with malicious intent.Currently, Similarly, Some of these companies have dropped Bitcanal since 2017, but most of them have stopped collaborating with the Portuguese ISP after a June 25 message posted on the NANOG (North American Network Operators' Group) mailing list.The message included evidence and a recount of at least 130 incidents during which Bitcanal appears to have intentionally carried out BGP hijacks.But there are also incidents when malicious ISPs intentionally announce a wrong BGP route in order to hijack traffic meant for particular targets, such as crucial DNS servers, financial services, government sites, military domains, and more. The purpose of these malicious BGP hijacks is the have traffic meant for those targets flow through the malicious ISP's network, where it can sniff its content or carry out Man-in-the-Middle attacks.Based on the evidence presented in the "I mean seriously, WTF?," Ronald F. Guilmette started his NANOG message.Guilmette alleges that Bitcanal is doing all of this 혰hijacking BGP routes혰 for the purpose of re-selling the hijacked IP addresses to spammer groups, which in turn use them to send out new spam campaigns from IPs not found in spam blacklists.According to a Doug Madory, Director of Internet Analysis at Oracle's Internet Intelligence team, and the author of the aforementioned blog post, says there are lessons to be learned from the past couple of weeks, for both Internet traffic transit providers, but also for Internet exchange points operators.BGP hijacks have been becoming rampant in recent years [With the first such collective ban being applied, maybe we can now look forward to quicker bans to other known offenders.
