一种新的未公开的DDoS攻击形式利用了通用即插即用（UPnP）网络协议中的一个众所周知的但仍然可利用的安全漏洞，以允许攻击者绕过常用的方法来检测其行为。为了避免将来发生的事件，人们很难确定它们的起源和黑名单，这种新的分布式拒绝服务攻击形式已经被发现并被UPnP协议详细地用于设备发现，该协议仍然被使用，尽管已知。在恶劣的缺省设置、缺乏认证和UPnP特定的远程代码执行漏洞的问题，这使得设备易受攻击。就像许多讨论的易开发的IOT设备的情况一样，大多数UPnP设备供应商更倾向于遵循协议和容易交付，而不是安全性，“IMPVA的安全研究小组负责人Avishay Zawoznik告诉ZDNET。”许多供应商重用开放式UPnP服务器实现。NoTestEngices为他们的设备，而不是费心修改它们以获得更好的安全性能。“协议的问题的例子一直追溯到2001，但是使用它的简单性意味着它仍然被广泛部署。然而，IMPVA研究人员声称发现了它如何被用来使DDoS攻击更难以攻击，这意味着广泛的问题。“我们发现了一种新的DDoS攻击技术，它使用已知的漏洞，并有可能使任何公司在网上出现。“攻击的风险，”Zawoznik说。研究人员首先注意到在四月简单服务发现协议（SSDP）攻击期间出现了一些新情况。这种类型的僵尸网络往往很小，并且欺骗受害者的IP地址，以便查询常见的互联网连接设备，如路由器、打印机和接入点，而大多数攻击是从通常的SSDP端口号1900到达的，大约有12%的有效负载到达F。ROM随机化源端口。研究发现，一个UPnP集成攻击方法可以用来隐藏源端口信息，攻击者可以很容易地找到设备来利用，以不受此影响，企业“应该提出一个基于分组有效载荷的DDoS保护，RATH”。然而，研究人员注意到，有一种相对简单的方法来保护系统免受这种和其他UNPNP漏洞的攻击：只是阻止了设备的远程访问，因为在绝大多数情况下，他们注意到“它没有任何有用的功能或H”。作为设备用户的任何好处。
A newly-uncovered form of DDoS attack takes advantage of a well-known, yet still exploitable, security vulnerability in the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) networking protocol to allow attackers to bypass common methods for detecting their actions.Attacks are launched from irregular source ports, making it difficult to determine their origin and blacklist the ports in order to protect against future incidents.The new form of distributed denial-of-service attack has been uncovered and detailed by The UPnP protocol is commonly used for device discovery, The protocol is still used, despite known issues around poor default settings, lack of authentication, and UPnP-specific remote code execution vulnerabilities, which make the devices vulnerable to attack. "Just like the much-discussed case of easily exploitable IoT devices, most UPnP device vendors prefer focusing on compliance with the protocol and easy delivery, rather than security," Avishay Zawoznik, security research team leader at Imperva, told ZDNet."Many vendors reuse open UPnP server implementations for their devices, not bothering to modify them for a better security performance."Examples of problems with the protocol go all the way back to 2001, but the simplicity of using it means it is still widely deployed. However, Imperva researchers claim the discovery of how it can be used to make DDoS attacks more difficult to attack could mean widespread problems."We have discovered a new DDoS attack technique, which uses known vulnerabilities, and has the potential to put any company with an online presence at risk of attack," said Zawoznik. Researchers first noticed something was new during a Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) attack in April. This type of botnet tends to be small and spoofs their victim's IP addresses in order to query common internet connected devices such as routers, printers and access points.While most of the attacks were arriving from the usual SSDP port number of 1900, around 12 percent of payloads were arriving from randomised source ports. Imperva investigated and found that a UPnP-integrated attack method could be used to hide source port information.Attackers could easily find devices to take advantage of In order to not fall victim to this, businesses "shouldcome up with a DDoS protection that is based on the packet payloads, rather than source ports only," said Zawoznik.However, researchers note that there is a relatively simple way to protect systems from this and other UNPnP exploits: just block the device from being remotely accessible, because in the vast majority of cases, they note, "it serves no useful function or has any benefit for device users".
