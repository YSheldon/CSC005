"While this development is a worrying one, applying a least access privilege model would reduce the threat greatly.Because the value of stolen data will more than make up for the cost of a stolen certificate, malicious actors are inclined to pay for certificates in order to fly under the radar of most protection tools so that they can hide in plain sight as authorized software. Malware purveyors seem focused on deep technical things until you see their real focus is actually a core business concept: ROI. Criminals are in it for the revenue, and they understand you have to spend money to make money," added Jonathan Sander, chief technology officer at STEALTHbits Technologies.The underground economy is growing because many organizations are rapidly expanding their use of code signing certificates. They are foundational components in many applications and DevOps environments. Unfortunately, in many cases code signing certificates are secured by unsuspecting teams that are focused on delivering code quickly, which allows attackers to intercept them, said Kevin Bocek, vice president of security strategy and threat intelligence at Organizations must have full control over every code signing certificate they use, especially during the software development pipeline and signing process, Bocek said.
