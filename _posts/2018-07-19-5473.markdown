Nabla containers use library OS - aka unikernel - techniques, specifically those from the Solo5 project, to avoid system calls and thereby reduce the attack surface. Nabla containers only use 9 system calls, all others are blocked via a Linux seccomp policy."There has been a fierce debate within the industry regarding whether isolated containers or virtual machines (VMs) are more secure. James Bottomley, IBM research engineer and Linux kernel developer, The researchers then tested Nabla through the metric of performance, and showed that it is "far and away the best containment technology for secure workloads given that it sacrifices the least performance over docker to achieve the containment." The blog also noted that Nabla was two-times more secure than using hypervisor-based containment. There
