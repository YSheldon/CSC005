When you see the figures, it's no surprise that the cost of cybercrime is causing considerable concern to governments and business leaders across the globe. Cybercrime costs almost $600bn worldwide, or 0.8 percent of global GDP, up from close to $500bn, or 0.7 percent of global income in 2014, according to a February 2018 By 2021, An international Compared with their peers, leaders in the Middle East ranked fears around cyber threats higher, at 54 percent, than anywhere else. More widely, cyber threats ranked just behind overregulation on 42 percent and terrorism, 41 percent, and on a par with geopolitical uncertainty.Fears about cybercrime feature strongly among leaders in the Middle East.The concerns of leaders in the Middle East and North Africa appear justified. CSIS and McAfee's study reported the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the second most targeted country in the world for cybercrime, costing the Emirate an estimated $1.4bn per year.Meanwhile, 2017's With 3.72 million people affected, which is more than half UAE's population, the impact, as in other countries, ranges from malware infections on 53 percent in UAE versus 48 percent globally, through to ransomware victims, 18 per cent of whom in UAE, and 17 percent globally, paid the ransom but did not receive access back to their files. Other Gulf nations are facing the same challenges. A recent Internet Security Threat Report, The same study ranked Oman fourth and found that the Sultanate is the country with the highest email malware rate in 2017, with one in 156 emails in the country deemed "malicious". With Saudi Arabia fifth and Kuwait eighth on this list, three Gulf countries were in Symantec's Top 10 nations for email malware last year; and four were in the top 10 for spam rates.Allied to this issue, as Gulf News "The astronomical rise in cryptocurrency values last year inspired many cybercriminals to shift to coinmining as an alternative revenue source," Haider Pasha, chief technology officer for emerging markets at Symantec Middle East told them.The rise in cybercrime has occurred despite heavy investment by Gulf Cooperation Council states in cyber protection, and the adoption of various measures including legislation, "Cybercrime threatens growth of the digital economy.

Papazian was one of the authors of a "In most countries, cybersecurity is still distributed across several government agencies, and there's no empowered centralized entity that builds momentum and ensures collaboration," he said.With new challenges such as illegal coinmining gaining momentum, arguably the need for bodies such as Saudi Arabia's "Most Gulf Cooperation Council cybercrime laws do not provide an adequate legal framework for cooperation," she wrote. "Nor do they include clear procedural provisions for implementation. In this sense, they are not fit for purpose. An overhaul of laws that addresses these gaps is needed."To this mix, we must also recognize that In the Middle East, the importance of smaller companies to local economies presents another challenge. Historically, this sector has Meanwhile, as the Government agencies, regulators, law makers, businesses and citizens must all play a role in tackling issues of cybercrime, as acknowledged by UAE's With even the most confident online users potentially falling prey to cyber attackers, These cybersecurity challenges at consumer, business, regulatory, and intra-government level are not unique to the region. But the extent of the region's exposure is well documented.In 2016, PwC Jump forward to 2018, and Deloitte Given a global landscape The rise of visually orientated social networks, video, and messaging apps is helping shape usage.Smartphone snoopers install malware which can provide attackers with information on almost every activity performed on the device.Some Middle Eastern countries seem to have a difficult relationship with VoIP services and messenger apps.A UK program offers young cybercriminals an alternative to detention and hopes to turn them into legit tech professionals.The Middle East and North Africa is a complex region, but mobile usage and services are changing fast.Mayer Brown partner and attorney Marcus Christian explains the exploit in Triconex systems, how hardware hacks work, and the legal ramifications of cyberattacks that target infrastructure.
