Google Chrome is enabling a new security feature called One day after a new Spectre-like attack This is the latest improvement for Chrome, widely considered to possess the best security features among different browsers.Google noted that the new feature will useÂ Â10-13%Â more memory, aÂ significant number the Chrome developers say they are working to reduce.Spectre and Meltdown use the speculative execution feature of a machineÂs processors to access memory that is supposed to be off-limits to users. Site Isolation aims to keep data in the same process so that a Spectre attack canÂt siphon off important data.The security feature is available in the current version (Chrome 67) of Chrome on Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome OS. The Chrome team is now working on extending the coverage to Android.The team didnÂt comment on updates to iOS.ÂSite Isolation is a large change to ChromeÂs architecture that limits each renderer process to documents from a single site,Â Google engineer Charlie Reis Although itÂs a significant change, it Âgenerally shouldnÂt cause visible changes for most users or web developers,Â Reis said. ÂIt simply offers more protection between websites behind the scenes.ÂThe old status quo was that within a single tab, an attacker could share a process with a victimÂs website with frames and cross-site pop-ups that could, if used in a successful Spectre attack, allow the attacker to read cookies and passwords within the same process.Enabling Site Isolation means a single process contains documents from a maximum of one site, so that cross-site iframes or pop-ups are different processes. Even if an attacker is successful with Spectre, there would be much less data to go after.ÂSplitting a single page across multiple processes is a major change to how Chrome works, and the Chrome Security team has been
