The US Department of Justice announced today charges against three Ukrainian nationals believed to be members of the infamous FIN7 (Carbanak or Cobalt) hacker group.The DOJ says the FIN7 group stole more than 15 million payment card numbers from over 6,000 point-of-sale (POS) terminals located at over 3,600 business locations. Officials said the three sold the payment card details they harvested on the Dark Web for profit.The charges are for crimes committed against US companies, but the group also hacked businesses in the UK, Australia, and France, the DOJ said.Some of the most well-known companies FIN7 has hacked include big names such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chili's, Arby's, Red Robin, and Jason's Deli.The three accused are Dmytro Fedorov, 44, aka "hotdima"; Fedir Hladyr, 33, aka "das" or "AronaXus"; and Andrii Kopakov, 30, aka "santisimo" all three Ukrainian nationals. Copies of indictments are available The DOJ describes Fedorov as "a high-level hacker and manager who allegedly supervised other hackers tasked with breaching the security of victims' computer systems."Fedorov was arrested in January 2018, in the city of Bielsko-Biala, Poland, where he remains in detention pending his extradition.Hladyr, the second suspect charged by the DOJ was also arrested in January 2018 in Dresden, Germany, and has been extradited to the US, where he is awaiting trial in Seattle.According to the DOJ, Hladyr served as "FIN7's systems administrator who, among other things, maintained servers and communication channels used by the organization and held a managerial role by delegating tasks and by providing instruction to other members of the scheme."The third charged hacker is Andrii Kopakov, who was arrested in March 2018, in the small Spanish city of Lepe, Spain.Europol announced El líder de una organización While the DOJ indictments only mention hacks against US retailers and payment card data harvesting, the FIN7 group is mostly known for hacking banks and financial institutions, from where, Kaspersky said in a FIN7, most widely known under the Carbanak name, was considered for a long time one of the most advanced hacking groups in existence.The group was active since 2013. The gang's activities can be split into three main phases, depending on the malware they used for attacks:But while the group's malware varied, the FIN7 gang always followed the same modus operandi when carrying out their attacks, a modus operandi that has since been copied by many other groups.All attacks would start with hackers sending spear-phishing emails to their targets. Emails used domain spoofing to impersonate legitimate business partners or collaborators and contained a file attachment with malicious software.The group was very creative with their attacks, and especially their spear-phishing tactics. For example, the group often Once FIN7 hackers gained access to these systems, and especially banks, hackers choose one of three methods of stealing money.The first was to coordinate with money mule groups and make ATMs spit out cash at a predetermined hour and day. Money mules would pick up the funds, and some of these funds would end up back with the FIN7 group after intermediaries took their cuts.Second, the group would transfer money from legitimate accounts to the ones they or their money mules owned, who would then empty accounts at ATMs, or use the accounts to buy expensive products and launder the money.Third, crooks would use the access to the bank's internal network to artificially inflate the money balance of accounts created by money mules in advance, without transferring funds from other accounts. Money mules would later empty these artificially-inflated accounts.Some of the criminal profits were also laundered via cryptocurrencies. Europol said in March that hackers also used prepaid cards linked to the cryptocurrency wallets which they used to buy goods such as luxury cars and houses.When FIN7 couldn't breach banks and larger financial entities, the DOJ says the group deployed malware on POS networks, malware that gathered payment card details and sent it back to the group.The entire FIN7 operation was a multi-faceted cybercrime machine with different groups focused on various operations.Similar to all large companies, the group often needed recruits to fill in new positions and areas of expertize. The DOJ says FIN7 ran a front company named Combi Security, headquartered in Russia, Ukraine, and Israel.US investigators claim the FIN7 group used this company to recruit new members. According to a The now-defunct combisecurity.com website But despite the arrests of these three main figureheads in the FIN7 operation, the group did not shut down.New attacks have been detected In a Cisco's report published earlier this week is titled "Multiple Cobalt Personality Disorder," and it details several malware distribution campaigns that appear to be carried out by FIN7 (Cisco calls them Cobalt), but which have small variations, suggesting that the split might have already happened.
