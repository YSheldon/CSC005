Additionally, Fulop wrote that DHS hosted a webinar on 23 July to share actionable information with its industry and government partners in an effort to help them protect their networks and improve the nations collective defense against cyber threats. "While hundreds of energy and non-energy companies were targeted, the incident where they gained access to the industrial control system was a very small generation asset that would not have had any impact on the larger grid if taken offline," said Fulop. "Over the course of the past year as we continued to investigate the activity, we learned additional information which would be helpful to industry in defending against this threat. We will continue our strong publicprivate partnership and remain vigilant in defending critical infrastructure.""Protecting our nations critical infrastructure is a shared responsibility between DHS and our public and private sector partners. Industry has invested significant resources in defending against nation state actors and this investment is working."  Part of that investment includes empowering service providers to identify weaknesses in third-party vendors, a critical security strategy intended to prevent these types of attacks. If they beat you just once by finding a single exploitable weakness within a single vendor, supplier or contractor, the results can be catastrophic. Rather than reacting to breaches like this after they occur, utilities providers need to take a more proactive approach to managing third-party risk, said That means identifying third parties with weak security controls before theyre exploited, and working with them to mitigate the risk of attacks and breaches before they become a target for attackers.In order to defend against Russia and other nation-state attacks, the cybersecurity community and the US government need to act, said Steve Kahan, CMO,
