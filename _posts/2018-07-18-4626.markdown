RoboCent, a Virginia Beach-based political robocall firm, has exposed the personal details of hundreds of thousands of US voters, according to the findings of a security researcher who stumbled upon the company's database online.The researcher, Bob Diachenko of Kromtech Security, says he discovered the data using a recently launched online service called Diachenko found RoboCent's exposed AWS bucket by searching for the term "voters." He searched for this particular term because last year, he also found a gigantic MongoDB database exposing the voter records of The server that drew Diachenko's attention, this time, contained 2,584 files, which the researcher later connected to RoboCent.The type of user data exposed via Robocent's bucket included:Other data found on the servers, but not necessarily personal data, included audio files with prerecorded political messages used for robocalls.According to "Clients can now purchase voter data directly from their RoboCall provider," the company's website reads. "We provide voter files for every need, whether it be for a new RoboCall or simply to update records for door knocking."The company sells voter records for a price of 3Ë˜/record. Leaving the core of its business available online on an AWS bucket without authentication is... self-defeating."We're a small shop (I'm the only developer) so keeping track of everything can be tough," a RoboCent employee told Diachenko.Leaks of US voter records have become common these days.
