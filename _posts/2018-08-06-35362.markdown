The company has spectrum it won in spectrum auctions (it was awarded AWS-4 spectrum in 2013) and through acquisitions (in 2012 it purchased spectrum in the 2 GHz range from bankrupt TerreStar Networks and DBSD North America). Specifically, the company has to deliver coverage to 70 percent of the population in the 176 markets where it has AWS-4 spectrum licenses by March 2020.During the companys second quarter earnings call, investors questioned Dishs ability to meet that goal. Some of Dishs spectrum is in the 600 MHz band, and existing holders of those 600 MHz licenses (TV broadcasters) have until July 2020 to clear that spectrum. Ergen admits that Dish is hampered by that factor, but he is confident the companys plan to start with a NB-IoT network first and then progress to a standalone 5G network later will work. Everything comes together in 2020 for us to build a modern network, Ergen said, according to a Seeking Alpha Ergen also noted that while U.S. wireless operators like ATT and Verizon are touting the fact they will have 5G deployed in some markets beginning later this year, they will not have a full 5G platform. The competitors will start building hybrid networks, but theyre not going to get a full 5G platform without ripping out what they already have, he said.Dish did provide investors with an update on its NB-IoT plans. Tom Cullen, head of corporate development with the company, said deployment of the NB-IoT network will begin in the fall, and the company has a team of employees dedicated to working on the network.Dish previously revealed that it expects to spend between $500 million and $1 billion on wireless through 2020. But Cullen declined to reveal the number of towers and cell sites Dish plans to have in place to meet the companys 2020 buildout goal.Nevertheless, Dish will face stiff competition in the NB-IoT arena.
