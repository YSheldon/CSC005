Security researchers have discovered a new exploit kit, currently active mainly in Asian countries, which, they say, has been busy spreading bootkits and cryptocurrency-mining (coinminer) malware.This new exploit kit (EK) has been named Underminer in a But fellow security firm Malwarebytes, which released an adjacent The EK appears to have spent quite a few months operating at a smaller scale before expanding its activity to other countries.According to Trend Micro, most of the web traffic flowing into Underminer is from Japan (70%), while the rest comes from Taiwan (10%), South Korea (6%), and other countries with smaller percentages.At the technical level, the exploit kit is still small in terms of the number of exploits it deploys to infect users with malware. Researchers have spotted only three. They are:None is specific to Underminer, and all have been used by other EKs in the past, suggesting the EK authors have built their operation by copying the ones before it.As for the malware delivery mechanism used in recent campaigns, the EK has been seen using encrypted TCP tunnels to deploy a bootkit first for OS persistence and then a coinminer.Trend Micro calls this coinminer "Hidden Mellifera," while Malwarebytes refers to it as "Hidden Bee," the same name it received in the Chinese infosec community last year, when it was first spotted and analyzed [Exploit kits have been on a downward trend in the past two-three years, and usually A few new exploits pop up on the market once in a while, but all are short-lived, as they have a hard time keeping their operation at profitable levels, mainly because
