当澳大利亚内政部正在训练面部识别系统时，它使用多种算法和多样的图像集合来避免系统中的任何偏倚。T：“我们一直在用一种广泛的算法来调整我们的算法，我们在澳大利亚非常幸运，我们是一个多元文化的社会，我们可以让来自不同民族的人出入全国。”Joe Fr代理情报和能力部副部长说。安子星期二告诉参议院的估计。T“我们不使用一个算法，我们使用了许多算法。”TrFrangz说，用于训练系统的数据集的大小是避免偏见的关键，并引用了一个未命名的中文系统的例子，该系统对亚洲面孔表现良好，但与其他种族的人进行了斗争。在与美国国家标准和技术研究所合作的基础上，弗兰齐声称家庭事务的算法排在前三位。他说，“这些大规模监控型面部识别解决方案中的一些在开发阶段非常有用，但是人们会满眼好奇，然后购买它们。”当你去参加会议的时候，他们表现得很好…而且它在受控环境中工作得很好，但是一旦你真的进入了一个真实的环境…然后你就得到了围绕着不同的灯光、脸部的角度、相机的位置、人们戴帽子、戴眼镜、戴帽子的问题。“这些事情已经发生了”，因为我们的机场里有很多人，我希望他们能无缝地走下去——离开A380——而且，随着时间的推移，我们离这一步不远了，随着面部表情的移动，人们的护照将留在他们的口袋里，”内政部长Peter Dutton在二月说。该部门也在面部识别系统中使用面部识别系统，上个月，民政事务局驳回了要求该系统要求认领权证的要求，说明该要求将“有效地防止政府机构使用这些服务，或获得好处。“服务”。民政事务总署写道：“获得认股权证是一个资源密集的过程，既适用于申请人机构，也适用于发行机构听取申请。”“准备、审查和授予使用服务的认股权证申请所涉及的时间将大大拖延，并在某些情况下破坏执法和国家安全调查；妨碍经营活动，包括预防犯罪行为；今年早些时候，该部门声称ITSton星期一，该部门透露，迄今为止，它已经从AU 1000万美元的预算中花费了550万美元用于整合工作，创造了“一些IT问题，这是政府部门的事实”。“令人遗憾的是，这是长期存在的，它可以追溯到20年前——在不同的网络上，”部门秘书Michael Pezzullo说。当你联合两个系统时，你必须建立Citrix和其他连接安排。这不是特别针对家庭事务，每当你有一个MOG——一个政府变革的机器时，它就会发生。
 tWhen Australia's Department of Home Affairs is training its facial recognition systems, it is using multiple algorithms and a diverse collection of imagery to avoid any bias in the system. t"We tune our algorithms all the time against a wide-ranging algorithm, we are very fortunate in Australia that we are a multicultural society, we get people coming in and out of the country from various nationalities," Acting Deputy Secretary of Intelligence and Capability at the department Joe Franzi told Senate Estimates on Tuesday. t"We don't use just one algorithm, we use a number of algorithms." tFranzi said the size of the data set used to train the system was key to avoiding bias, and cited the case of an unnamed Chinese system that performed well against Asian faces but struggled with people of other races. tBased on working with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, Franzi claimed Home Affairs' algorithms are in the top three. tResponding tot"Some of these mass surveillance-type facial recognition solutions are very much in the development phase -- but people get starry eyed and they buy them," he said. t"They perform really well when you go to the conference ... and it works really well in a controlled environment, but once you actually move into a real world environment ... then you get all the issues around different lighting, angles of faces, where are cameras, do people have hats on, glasses on, [hoodies] -- a whole range of things." tHome Affairs has beent"For the numbers of people coming through our airports, I want them to walk seamlessly down -- off the A380 -- and, in time, and we're not far off this, with facial recognition on the move, people's passports will stay in their pocket," Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said in February. tThe department is also using facial recognition in its face-matching system that willtLast month, Home Affairs dismissed calls for the system to require a warrant to access, stating the requirement would "effectively prevent government agencies from using the services, or obtaining the benefits of the services". t"Obtaining a warrant is a resource-intensive process, both for the applicant agency and for the issuing authority hearing the application," Home Affairs wrote. t"The time involved in preparing, reviewing, and granting a warrant application to use services would significantly delay, and in some circumstances undermine, law-enforcement and national security investigations; impede operational activity, including the prevention of criminal acts; and divert resources from investigations." tEarlier this year, the department claimed that itstOn Monday, the department revealed it had spent AU$5.5 million so far from its AU$10 million budget on integration work in creating thet"There were some IT issues that were a function of the fact that government agencies are regrettably -- and this is longstanding; it goes back 20 years -- still on different networks," departmental secretary Michael Pezzullo said. t"When you federate two systems, you've got to set up Citrix and other connection arrangements. That's not particularly specific to Home Affairs; it happens whenever you have a MOG -- a machinery-of-government change."
