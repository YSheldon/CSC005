The administration's decision to allow people to post blueprints online about how to make a deadly 3D printed gun at home is inexplicable  and it's dangerous! Im filing a bill ASAP to severely restrict the publication of these detailed plans on how to make a 3D printed firearm. https://t.co/ogRLcHLJPO
