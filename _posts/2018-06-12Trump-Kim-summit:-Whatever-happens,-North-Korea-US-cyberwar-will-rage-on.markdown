美国和朝鲜的领导人唐纳德·特朗普总统和Kim Jong Un将于明天会面，今天的安全威胁在范围和严肃性上都有所扩大。当信息安全没有得到妥善处理时，现在可能有几百万甚至数十亿美元的风险。无论峰会是否成功，两位球员仍将沉浸在一种令人不安的趋势中：美国和朝鲜从来都不是最好的朋友。然而，两个国家都拥有足够的火力——无论是在物理领域还是在数字领域，TT TyMcRead都可能不在峰会的议程上，但数字武器仍然会使人衰弱，两国都在进行培训，因此我们听到了更多关于朝鲜一般TTTTAS的信息。峰会的临近，让我们来看看美国和朝鲜过去的关系，黑客的历史，以及选择的虚拟武器。在第二次世界大战结束后，美国在1948年底通过全国性的选举提议统一，但双方缺乏信任，这意味着这件事从未发生过。TTTT韩国南部在1948宣布独立，并积极推进工业化，创造了我们今天所知道的高科技国家，这是世界上一些最先进的科技公司的所在地。相比之下，苏联在北境任命金日成为王朝王位后，官方称为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国（朝鲜），该国获得了“隐士王国”的绰号。运动的TTTBurthWatch Watch称朝鲜是“世界上最压制性的独裁国家之一”，美国和朝鲜的关系在过去几乎是不可抗拒的敌意。北韩一直在进行核计划，并进行了多年的试验。2002，布什政府报道了美国、中国、朝鲜和其他国家的外交努力失败的证据。朝鲜积极推进核试验，令国际社会深感沮丧。TTTTIN 2017，该国发射了超过20枚导弹并进行了第六次核试验，以及一枚弹道导弹，朝鲜威胁要攻击关岛，声称该行动将“向美国发出严重的警告信号”。九月，美国总统特朗普称其朝鲜半岛。TTREST是“TTTTIN，基姆称特朗普为TTTTAT”这一点，我们中的许多人集体持有我们的头在我们的手中，在怀疑的国家代表的幼稚的行为与核电的掌握，泥泥人握手的照片机会的想法。似乎是不可能的。TTTTHOWEL，在一个令人惊讶的举动，基姆和特朗普同意会晤，导致预期Trump Kim首脑会议的形成。TTTT:这两人将在翻译人员的帮助下进行一对一的会晤，而不是助手，在新加坡的两个军事力量之间的Tuesday.ttttAn协议中，不把我们全部投入核战争只能被认为是积极的，但是当涉及到网络安全和网络战争时，还没有。对桌子有任何保证。所有的，网络间谍和网络攻击都是有利可图的，对竞争对手来说是不稳定的，是对情报搜集的一种恩惠，并且可以在很多方面帮助统治力量秘密地、悄悄地实现他们的目标。事实上，你不一定把朝鲜和先进的黑客组织联系起来。国家的资源是有限的，我们认为理所当然的核心服务——比如电力——是稀缺的，除非你住在这个国家的首都平壤，即使如此，只有两个主要的互联网线路，通过中国和俄罗斯，连接朝鲜到其余的T。他的世界。互联网的使用受到国家“STTTTSO”的严厉审查和控制，国家如何能够支持先进的网络间谍活动？TTTWTARVEL不仅仅是通过火箭，外交和经济实力，或者步兵股赢得了这些天。相反，在数字世界中，信息可以在全球平台上保持竞争优势的关键。TTTT根据CytEason情报研究高级主管Ross Rustici所说，“TTTT报道的[朝鲜]已经多次证明他们非常非常有能力，”研究人员说。ttttPriscilla Moriuchi，战略威胁发展总监在未来的记录，告诉出版物，该国运行的“网络训练管道”旨在打击黑客。TTTT“他们会在数学或科学和技术中学到孩子，把他们送到一两所特殊的中学，过滤到一两所大学，”安全专家说。金日成大学与Kim Cha
 t tttttThe leaders of the US and North Korea, President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, are due to meet tomorrow.Today's security threats have expanded in scope and seriousness. There can now be millions -- or even billions -- of dollars at risk when information security isn't handled properly. ttttWhether the summit succeeds or fails, both players will still indulge themselves in a disturbing trend: atThe United States and North Korea have never been the best of friends, to put it lightly.

Instead, in a digital world, information can hold the key to competitive advantage on the global platform. ttttAccording to Ross Rustici, senior director for intelligence research at Cybereason, as reported bytttt"[North Koreans] have proven time and again that they are very, very capable," the researcher said. ttttPriscilla Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, told the publication that the country runs a "cyber training pipeline" designed to crank out hackers. tttt"They would identify kids with promise in math, or science and technology in middle school, send them to one or two particular middle schools, that filter into one or two universities," the security expert said. ttttPyongyang's Kim Il-sung University and Kim Chaek University of Technology are believed to be the training grounds for the country's hacking teams. Once qualified, many go on to join what is known as Bureau 121, part of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau. ttttMany of the best and brightest end up overseas, such as in China, India, and Cambodia. ttttA defector and former hacker for DPRKttttWherever they may be, North Korean hackers, backed by the state and behaving based on the DPRK ruling party's wishes, are believed to be responsible for a vast array of bold attacks in the name of money, or the reputation of the regime. Some of these include, but are not limited to: tNorth Korean threat actors, believed to number in the thousands, often create their own malware tools through modular designs but have also been known to rip software source code apart in order to rebuild it in North Korea's image. ttttAside from Red Star -- which looks suspiciously similar to Apple'sttttVersions of the apparent antivirus in the wild which contain hidden Trojans for cyberespionage purposes have been recorded. ttttNorth Korean threat actors, such as the Reaper APT ( tt ttttThe US is no angel, either, when it comes to cyberespionage. The country has a long history of covert and clandestine activity -- against not only rival countries but its own citizens -- which has simply spread to embrace cyber warfare. t ttttThe US may not have to hide its operations so fiercely, especially if such actions are deemed to be in the interest of "national security," but there are many incidents -- such as those listed below -- which may be dubious when considered in the balance between national security and individual rights to privacy. ttttThe skills of US law enforcement to hack computer systems have evolved beyond the use of keyloggers to compromising Tor, which is no mean feat. However, in the same breath, technological advances -- such as the use of encryption -- has made life difficult for US teams. ttttLikely to the US government's chagrin, its own mass data collection activities, implemented through the US National Security Agency (NSA) and leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, eventtttNonetheless, the US government pours vast resources into strengthening its cyber warfare capabilities. ttttNothing is off the table.

Either way, should a rapport be established between these two unlikely characters, discussions, one day, will likely also include the pressing matter of cyberespionage and cyberattacks as a whole. t ttttNo country is innocent of such tactics, and state-sponsored attacks from every corner have the capability to take down our core services, our financial systems, and devastate our economies. ttttGovernments may overstep the mark, but these are the same individuals which choose whether or not they have -- and what the consequences may be. tt ttThe deal with ZTE was a 'personal favour' to the Chinese president, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has said, and it boosted 'goodwill' for the North Korea summit. t tt ttNorth Korea is a bizarre country that almost seems frozen in time -- a bizarre, frozen-in-time, armed-to-the-teeth, crazy-dangerous country.
