就像医生，不像医生，没有他们的理由？这比什么都不做或者比客户前一天做的更好。这种观点是短视的，表明他们对客户的风险缺乏理解。是对供应商的有意还是无知？企业能做些什么来保护自己呢？我们如何进入一个新的网络安全行业精神，专注于可行的解决方案，并致力于无害化？苹果、谷歌和微软在技术和开发者身上花费了数百万美元，以锁定OS和构建弹性子系统，以使攻击者在时间和劳动力方面非常昂贵，例如，安全厂商（包括许多Bigg）。端点、网络安全和容器安全的EST品牌通过打破在所有主要操作系统中建立的默认安全边界引入新的漏洞和附加风险。许多端点和网络安全厂商通过增加复杂性来引入新的攻击表面。而不是寻找问题的根本原因，他们继续分支并应用点解决方案。有时，这些解决方案打破了由平台供应商建立的默认安全设计原则。因此，不使用特权分离和沙箱的端点和反病毒软件供应商在端点的最高特权级别上创建新的和大的攻击表面。网络安全设备本质上是基础设施安全供应商暴露客户虚拟机数据ST。使用具有root权限的主机运行的复杂解析器。除了上面明显的危险行为之外，还有一个整体的解决方案，我称之为顺势疗法。从本质上讲，这些不会造成危害，也不会解决任何问题。您可以安全地列出该子集中的大部分治理、风险和符合性（GRC）解决方案。作为一个行业，当我们不仅解决了他们真正的安全问题，而且暴露了更严重的问题时，我们对我们的客户和他们的信任造成了损害。在TAP端口上的网络设备是比安装前一天忍受的任何其他系统风险更高的系统风险。在我的经验中，许多人有一些提示和问题，可以帮助我们摆脱混合信息的泥潭，了解炒作背后的真相。我们必须在网络安全行业中进行道德上的转变。大多数解决方案类似于黑暗时代的放血疗法。如果你不从他们身上死去，算你幸运。我在这个行业已经有20多年了。我们的道德准则被打破了，我们需要为更大的利益而行动，而不是自我提升来填补我们的口袋。我们必须在大规模的“灭绝”事件之前采取行动。我们承受不起这样的灾难。我挑战我的安全行业领袖们做出必要的改变，以使我们的产业得到所有的利益。司楠耳恩是首席执行官。
Much like physicians,Unlike physicians, no Their rationale? That it is better than doing nothing or better than what the customer had in place the day before. This argument is short-sighted and indicates a lack of comprehension of the risk they are imparting to their customers. Is it intentional or mere ignorance on the part of the vendors? And what can enterprises do to protect themselves? How do we get to a new cybersecurity industry ethos, focused on viable solutions and committed to doing no harm? Apple, Google, and Microsoft have spent millions of dollars, on both technology and developers, to lock down the OS and build resiliency subsystems to make exploitation highly expensive for the attacker in terms of time and labor -- for example, And yet, security vendors (including many of the biggest brands in endpoint, network security and container security) introduce new vulnerabilities and additional risk by breaking the default security boundaries established in all the major operating systems.Many endpoint and network security vendors introduce new attack surfaces by adding complexity. Instead of looking at the root cause of an issue, they continue to branch out and apply point solutions.Sometimes, these solutions break the default secure design principles established by the platform vendors. Endpoint and anti-virus software vendors that do not use privilege-separation and sandboxing therefore create a new and large attack surface at the highest privilege level of the endpoint.Network security appliances are essentiallyInfrastructure security vendors expose guest virtual machine data streams to a complex parser running at the host with root privileges. The In addition to the clearly risky behaviors above, there is a whole subset of solutions that I call homeopathic. Essentially, these do no harm -- but also do not solve any problems. You can safely list most of the governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solutions under this subset. As an industry, we do a disservice to our customers and the trust that they put in us when we not only solve their real security issues but expose them to much worse. That network appliance on the tap port is a higher order systemic risk than anything else they endured the day before its installation. In my experience, many Here are a few tips and questions that help cut through the morass of mixed messages and get to the truth behind the hype.We must have an ethical shift in the cybersecurity industry. The majority of solutions are akin to the bloodletting "cures" of the dark ages. Count yourself lucky if you don't die from them. I have been in this industry for over 20 years. Our moral compass is broken and we need to act for the greater good rather than for self-promotion to fill our pockets. We must take action before a massive "extinction-like" event. A We cannot afford such a catastrophe. I challenge my fellow security industry leaders to make the changes necessary to evolve the industry for all our benefit.Sinan Eren is chief executive of
