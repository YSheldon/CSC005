36岁的法国国民加尔·瓦勒里斯于本周在美国认罪，罪名是“OxMONSTORT”，他在黑暗的网络上贩卖毒品。去年九月，美国当局在抵达美国参加世界博览会后，在亚特兰大机场逮捕了瓦勒里斯。在德克萨斯州的奥斯丁举行的ARD和胡子锦标赛中，根据法庭文件，美国当局设法将瓦勒瑞斯认定为氧怪物，并在发现他的一个比特币账户后继续监视他。阿勒里斯为他的服务。与梦幻市场上的大多数供应商不同，Ox怪物没有配置小费来通过市场的内部支付系统，它通过一个转筒/混合器（交易匿名器）通过交易，但是设置Tip JAR以在他建立的比特币地址中接收资金。NrStand得到了最初的线索，可能是谁在OxyMonster monicker后面。他们的猜疑后来被证实了。在对Ox怪物和ValruriS的写作风格的分析中，他们发现他们是同一个人。去年秋天，当Vallerius第一次来到美国时，边境探员让他在机场进行搜查。一个后来被查获的笔记本电脑的搜索结果证实了Vallerius是氧怪物。在笔记本电脑上发现了犯罪证据的代理，如OxyMonster用来在线签署邮件的PGP加密密钥、梦幻市场的Ox怪物登录凭据和含有B的比特币钱包。ITBEN地址与OxyMonster的供应商帐户有关。最初的刑事申诉试图将氧怪物作为可卡因、芬太尼、甲基苯丙胺、LSD和羟考酮等多个控制物质的销售者。在九个月后试图避免终身监禁在美国，V。Aulrures本周签署了一项认罪请求，承认在OxMod的名义下在梦市场上出售羟考酮和利他林。ValruriS也在OxMoor的市场上，在黑暗的网络市场上作为VanDeevp，在AlphaBay、汉莎市场、TruteouTe、Valhal等多个市场上有账户。洛杉矶，和进化。尽管他的罪行和当局如何跟踪他，氧怪物将永远记住他的胡须和愚蠢的方式被逮捕。总之，这只是另一种情况，当局再次证明，比特币作为一种隐秘性并不是真正的匿名。就像过去十年的广告一样。
Gal Vallerius, a 36-year-old French national pleaded guilty this week in the US of selling narcotics on the Dark Web under the nickname of OxyMonster.US authorities arrested Vallerius in September last year, at the Atlanta airport after he arrived in the US to attend and participate in the World Beard and Mustache Championships that was being held in Austin, Texas.According to court documents, US authorities managed to identify Vallerius as OxyMonster and keep him under surveillance after they discovered one of his Bitcoin accounts.In a The tip jar was meant to allow users or buyers to tip Vallerius for his services. Unlike most vendors on the Dream Market, OxyMonster did not configure the tips to go through the marketplace's internal payment systems, which passed transactions through a tumbler/mixer (transaction anonymizer), but set the tip jar to receive funds in a Bitcoin address he set up.This allowed law enforcement to get an initial clue of who may be behind the OxyMonster monicker. Their suspicions were later confirmed when an analysis of OxyMonster and Vallerius' writing styles suggested they were the same person.When Vallerius traveled to the US for the first time last fall, border agents subjected him to a search in the airport. A search of his laptop, which was later seized, confirmed that Vallerius was OxyMonster.Agents found incriminating evidence on the laptop, such as the PGP encryption key that OxyMonster used to sign messages online, OxyMonster login credentials for the Dream Market, and Bitcoin wallets containing Bitcoin addresses associated with OxyMonster's vendor accounts.The original criminal complaint tried to peg OxyMonster as a seller of several controlled substances such as cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine, LSD, and oxycodone.After nine months trying to avoid a lifetime prison sentence in the US, Vallerius signed a guilty plea this week, admitting to selling Oxycodone and Ritalin on the Dream Market under the name of OxyMonster.Besides OxyMonster, Vallerius also went on Dark Web markets as VanDeevp, and had accounts on multiple marketplaces, such as AlphaBay, Hansa Market, TradeRoute, Valhalla, and Evolution.Despite his crimes and how authorities tracked him down, OxyMonster will always be remembered for his glorious beard and the silly way he was arrested.All in all, this is just another case where authorities have proven once more that Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency isn't really anonymous as it was advertised for the past decade.
