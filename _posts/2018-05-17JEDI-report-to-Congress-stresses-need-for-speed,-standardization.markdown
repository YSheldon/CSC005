国防部在5月7日提交给国会的一份报告中提到，在全面拨款法案中，五角大楼为在单一奖励合同下获得支持军事行动和作战的云计算能力提供了辩护。绝地（联合企业防御基础设施）计划证明了争议。国防部部长James Mattis试图最终提出对云供应商的建议，这个月预计将于九月到期。根据这份报告，单奖合同是必要的，以避免多个奖励合同的步伐，随后是单独的任务单。STEP可以防止国防部迅速向企业级云计算的新战斗机提供新的能力和提高的效能，“五角大厦首席管理官John Gibson II说，”报告还断言“不一致和非标准化的INF”。跨分类级别的结构使软件应用程序的开发和分发复杂化，潜在地增加了延迟和成本，并且潜在地抑制了诸如人工智能和机器学习等先进技术的使用。D云采纳实践目前在国防部进行。报告指出，有超过500的云获取和迁移努力，“这让人想起了DOD当前的遗留信息技术环境，这是21世纪没有优化的，分散的移动到云”创造了无数的接缝，不一致的基线和额外的。报告说：“在企业级管理数据和服务的复杂性。”在众多云层中散射国防部的数据进一步抑制了访问和分析关键数据的能力。“虽然没有对绝地项目的具体预算请求，但国防部正在寻求2019财年的云计算3亿9300万美元，高于2018美元的2亿3000万美元。预计到2020，这将扩大到5亿美元，然后从2021到2023下降到2亿5000万美元左右。总的来说，五年的花费是16亿美元。报告还说，绝地可以与国防信息系统局的米尔云2协调工作，米尔云为国防机构提供了一个节省成本的平台，以降低托管成本。据报道，目前被称为“第四地产”的国防机构被优先考虑迁移到米尔云2，一旦绝地成立，海军、海军陆战队、运输指挥部和国防媒体活动将充当开拓者来考验五角大楼的能力。提供和管理云迁移和活动。报告还强调，绝地收购战略包括退出计划，以防初始合同不按计划进行。该协议的基本订购期预计为两年，获胜的供应商将需要有一个“详细的便携性计划”来移动和销毁应用程序和数据。政府范围内的技术政策和退伍军人事务部。在加入FCW之前，MZMANIAN是国家期刊的技术记者，并在B2B新闻服务StaskExcel中担任各种编辑角色。MZMANIAN曾向华盛顿邮报、华盛顿城市报、新闻报、纽约出版社、建筑师杂志和其他出版物发表评论和文章。注册我们的新闻报刊。TTI同意这个网站的
DefenseIn a May 7 report to Congress ordered in the omnibus spending bill, the Pentagon defended plans to acquire cloud computing capabilities to support military operations and warfighting under a single-award contract.The JEDI (Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure) plan has proved controversialDefense Secretary James Mattis tried to A final request for proposals for cloud vendors is expected to land this month, with an award due in September.The single-award contract is needed, accord to the report, to avoid the pace of a multiple-award contract followed by individual task orders."That pace could prevent DOD from rapidly delivering new capabilities and improved effectiveness to the warfighter that enterprise-level cloud computing can enable," the report from Pentagon Chief Management Officer John Gibson II states.The report also asserts that "inconsistent and non-standardized infrastructures across classification levels complicates development and distribution of software applications, potentially adding delays and costs" and potentially inhibiting the use of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.The report is also critical of the federated cloud adoption practice currently in place at DOD. There are more than 500 cloud acquisition and migration efforts, the report notes, which are "reminiscent of DOD's current legacy information technology environment, which is not optimized for the 21The decentralized move to the cloud has "created numerous seams, incongruent baselines and additional layers of complexity for managing data and services at an enterprise level," the report states. "Scattering DOD's data across a multitude of clouds further inhibits the ability to access and analyze critical data."While there's no specific budget request for the JEDI program, the DOD is seeking $393 million for cloud computing in fiscal year 2019, up from $230 million in 2018. That is expected to expand to $500 million in 2020, before dropping to what appears to be a sustainment level budget of about $250 million from 2021 through 2023. Overall, the five-year spend is pegged at $1.6 billion.The report also states that JEDI can work in harmony with milCloud 2.0 from the Defense Information Systems Agency, with milCloud offering a kind of cost-saving staging area for defense agencies looking to reduce hosting costs. Currently defense agencies known collectively as the "fourth estate" are being prioritized for migration to milCloud 2.0, the report states.Once JEDI is in place, the Navy, Marine Corps, Transportation Command and the Defense Media Activity will act as trailblazers to test the Pentagon's ability to provision and manage cloud migration and activity.The report also stresses that the JEDI acquisition strategy includes an exit plan in case the initial contract doesn't work out as planned. The base ordering period on the deal is expected to be two years, and the winning vendor will be required to have a "detailed portability plan" to move and destroy applications and data as necessary.About the AuthorBefore joining the editing team, Mazmanian was an FCW staff writer covering Congress, government-wide technology policy and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
