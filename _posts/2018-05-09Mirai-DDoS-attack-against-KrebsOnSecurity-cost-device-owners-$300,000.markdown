研究人员建议，分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）将KRBOSONN安全性离线几天，导致设备所有者不知不觉地参与了攻击300000美元。DDoS攻击发生在2016，通过MiaI僵尸网络（MiaI僵尸网络）成为可能。物联网（IOT）设备，包括路由器、监视摄像机和智能家居系统。不存在的或不良的安全实践，包括使用硬编码和工厂密码，允许僵尸网络的操作员冲刷网络以连接和奴役这些设备。为启动攻击者所需的带宽能够粉碎KReBSCAN安全域并阻止合法的流量通过。访问中断对访问者来说是一种烦恼，而对云安全提供商攻击的代价是抵御620 Gbps DDoS攻击，W。HICH最终可能达到数百万美元，导致谷歌的项目盾，有另一个成本，而不是一个必须立即显现-美玲的奴役设备的所有者是支付威胁演员的电力使用和带宽消耗的支付者。在对DDoS攻击发起的一项新的研究中，根据加利福尼亚大学伯克利信息学院的研究人员对这种物联网攻击的直接成本的新研究，攻击持续了77个小时，由24000个不安全的物联网设备供电，这是TBKELLY研究者BA。他们对用MiAI沙箱版测试的设备进行了估计。DDoS攻击的设备所有者平均每小时0.42美元的功率，基于低、中、高成本的电力设备中的设备分布。由于Wi-Fi和以太网OpTIO，由于低、中、高成本区，带宽的成本更难以估计。NS。然而，作为一个合计的数量，伯克利研究人员认为，MiLAI公司的DDoS攻击成本为每小时4207.03美元。平均每个攻击的设备估计每个产品的所有者成本为13.50美元。“攻击我的网站的攻击者支付了几百美元。克雷布斯说：“租一个更大的MiaLi犯罪机器的一小部分。”那次袭击可能要花费数百万美元来减轻。拥有IOT设备的消费者可能在每一次的损失中都实现了几美元的损失。对许多人来说，S可能是不可察觉的，特别是当没有带宽上限时，但是抵御MiRAI攻击和类似僵尸网络的运营成本可能会削弱个人业务、云服务和大企业。
ttThe distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) which knocked KrebsOnSecurity offline for days cost owners of devices unwittingly involved in the attack upwards of $300,000, researchers suggest.tThe DDoS attack took place in 2016 and was made possible through the Mirai botnet, a network of enslaved Internet of Things (IoT) devices including routers, surveillance cameras, and smart home systems.tNon-existent or poor security practices, including the use of hardcoded and factory passwords, allowed the operators of the botnet to scour the web for the means to hook up and enslave these devices, providing the bandwidth necessary to launch an attack able to smash the KrebsOnSecurity domain and prevent legitimate traffic from getting through.tThe access disruption was an annoyance for visitors and a tThe cost of the attack to the cloud security provider in fending off the 620 Gbps DDoS assault, which could have eventually reached millions of dollars, led to Google's Project Shield tHowever, there was another cost and not one that would necessarily be immediately apparent --the owners of devices enslaved by Mirai were the ones paying for the threat actor's power usage and bandwidth consumption in launching the DDoS attack.tAccording to a new study into the direct cost of such IoT-fueled attacks by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley School of Information, tThe attack lasted 77 hours and was powered by 24,000 insecure IoT devices, which was tBerkeley researchers based their estimates on devices tested with a sandboxed version of Mirai. The DDoS onslaught cost device owners an average of $0.42 per hour in power, based on the distribution of devices in low, medium, and high-cost electricity zones.tThe cost of bandwidth was more difficult to estimate, owing to low, medium, and high-cost zones, in addition to Wi-Fi and Ethernet options. However, as an aggregated amount, Berkeley researchers believe the Mirai-fueled DDoS attack cost $4,207.03 per hour.tOn average, each device involved in the attack is estimated to have cost individual owners $13.50 per product.t"The attacker who wanted to clobber my site paid a few hundred dollars to rent a tiny portion of a much bigger Mirai crime machine," Krebs noted. "That attack would likely have cost millions of dollars to mitigate. The consumers in possession of the IoT devices that did the attacking probably realized a few dollars in losses each, if that."t"Perhaps forever unmeasured are the many Web sites and Internet users whose connection speeds are often collateral damage in DDoS attacks," the security expert added.ttThis may be unnoticeable to many especially when there are no bandwidth caps in place, but the operating costs of fending off Mirai attacks and similar botnets can be crippling to individual businesses, cloud services, and the enterprise at large.t
