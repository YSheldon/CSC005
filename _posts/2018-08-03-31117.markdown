Oracle: your GDPR implementation is anti-consumer, bad faith, crap and doesnÂ’t mean ICO guidance. To opt out I had to change the default (yes to no), had to then confirm twice, then wait several minutes, then do the whole process again in HTTP. It took 4 minutes to reach site. https://t.co/Wq36qkq1m9
