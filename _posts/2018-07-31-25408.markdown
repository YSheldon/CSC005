Facebook announced today that it removed 32 Facebook and Instagram accounts and pages for exhibiting behavior consistent a political influence campaign, which Facebook said it previously saw during the 2016 US Presidential Election.In particular, Facebook said it removed 17 Facebook accounts, eight Facebook pages, and seven Instagram profiles for what the social network categorized as "coordinated inauthentic behavior."Facebook says it identified this coordinated network two weeks ago and had spent the past weeks trying to track down its members.According to preliminary results of its investigation, Nathaniel Gleicher, Head of Cybersecurity Policy at Facebook, said these accounts had been created between March 2017 and May 2018.Gleicher says Facebook staff identified some thin links connecting some of these accounts and pages to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian-based entity that was But according to the Facebook exec, this time around, the people behind these accounts took much greater care to hide their identities compared to the 2016 campaign.Gleicher says these threat actors used VPNs and internet phone services to hide their location following Facebook's crackdown on IRA and other fake accounts in recent months. Gleicher details:Facebook also published images showing the type of content the Facebook pages published, including posts and events they tried to organize.Facebook has not yet officially attributed these fake accounts and pages to the IRA or the Russian government, like in 2016. But the social network did point out some connections."One of the IRA accounts we disabled in 2017 shared a Facebook Event hosted by the 'Resisters' Page [the one disabled today]," Facebook said. "This Page also previously had an IRA account as one of its admins for only seven minutes."Facebook said it already shared the information about today's suspended accounts with US law enforcement, Congress, other technology companies, and the Atlantic CouncilÂ’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, a research organization that helps Facebook identify and analyze abuse on its network.Facebook also announced it would start notifying users who were interested (around 2,600) and users who said would attend events (around 600) created by one of the suspended accounts and pages.According to a February indictment, the DOJ revealed that in the 2016 election meddling campaign, IRA fake Facebook accounts, pages, and groups often posted content on dividing topics or organized events and rallies, often for conflicting causes to pit the two groups together in order to exacerbate opposing political views inside the US.Facebook may not have pointed the finger at the IRA or Russia just yet, but the modus operandi is consistent with past IRA election meddling tactics.
