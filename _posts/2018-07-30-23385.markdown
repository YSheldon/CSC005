Cyber-criminals, who measure the return on investment of their ad spend by comparing it to the money they make from crypto-mining and ransom, are compromising the legitimate business of online advertising, exploiting it to display malware-infected ads.Recognizing that threat actors will always search for new ways to spread their attack campaigns, researchers anticipate seeing more of these types of attacks, though the involvement of seemingly legitimate online advertising companies is of great concern. We cant help but wonder  is the online advertising industry responsible for the publics safety? Indeed, how can we be certain that the advertisement we encounter while visiting legitimate websites are not meant to harm us? the researchers wrote.
