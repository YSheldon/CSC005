(Image: Tapplock)For the second time this week, smart lock maker Tapplock is under fire over its security.Security researcher The Internet of Things explained: What the IoT is, and where it's going next.He demonstrated how to retrieve the lock's last known postal address, and enough data to create an unlock code, which can be used to locate and open any smart lock.Stykas' work builds on research published Tapplock said In a statement Friday, Tapplock confirmed it has pulled the API, which the app relies on to wirelessly open the lock using Bluetooth, given the risk of a data breach.The lock can still be opened with a user's fingerprint and the "This patch addresses several security issues and upgrades Tapplock's communication and authentication security protocols. We will continue to monitor the latest security trends and provide updates from time to time," the company said.Stykas shared The API requires a registered email address to work, which anyone can create using the mobile app. Using a few terminal commands that anyone can run from their computer, Stykas showed a malicious actor could obtain the lock's location and its MAC address, which, using Tierney's technique, can be easily converted to a code that can unlock the device in a close proximity.Stykas also found that every time a new fingerprint was enrolled with a user's lock, a new record was uploaded to the server and was given a unique, automatically incrementing user number -- making it easy to try different user number combinations and obtain other users' data.And because he found no evidence that the API was rate-limited, he said anyone could pull as much user data from the server as they want.He also explained he could permanently share any lock with any other users' account without the owner's consent."I would not buy this lock," said Stykas, in Tapplock also came under fire earlier this month after its "unbreakable durability" claim was disproved. A YouTube user, JerryRigEverything, The company said this one lock had a manufacturing defect, and all other locks were safe.You can send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755–8849.
