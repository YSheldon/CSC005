澳大利亚的网络协调员阿拉斯泰尔Miggbon，面对参议院的估计，在他的政策能力，向内政部部长报告，他说他相信澳大利亚人的数据在微软手中是安全的，尽管华盛顿总部的公司有S。四月，微软收到了澳大利亚信号局（ASD）的认证，允许其存储对云服务的保护级别认证，目前是ASD在其认证的云服务列表（CCSL）上批准的最高安全级别。OsFFT成为第二个获得认证的国际球员，第五个在CSCL上，在此之前，微软于六月收到了微软Azure工程导联，作为澳大利亚公司的澳大利亚国家技术官J·卡瓦纳，被ZDNETH问及。该公司的当地分支机构打算接受保护级别认证，作为该认证的要求之一，要求该公司拥有位于澳大利亚边界的所有员工和数据中心。Kavanagh说，有“下游服务”允许政府机关。雷德蒙的分类在一定程度上是通过星期二参议院面临的一个估计，澳大利亚绿党参议员Jordon Steele John问MacGibbon是否存储在澳大利亚微软Azure云上的信息。MacGibbon先生告诉参议院法律和宪法，“我感到满意的是，微软Azure，在其被保护的形式，由信号局认证或澳大利亚信号安全中心在信号局将存储在澳大利亚。”星期二，“数据可以驻留在世界任何地方，你可以要求数据留在澳大利亚，但它并不总是使它更安全，它是在一个特定的地理…我们在澳大利亚持有数据是好的，这意味着数据是在澳大利亚法律下的，这意味着机构和其他人有更多的机会访问它，而其他国家的机构理论上无法访问这些数据。“MacGibbon，如果微软员工在海外工作，拒绝特别回答。位于澳大利亚的LD Access数据称，他对微软公司的数据访问人员感到满意，将“适当地清除”。“我很满意微软将在澳大利亚存储数据，但仅仅因为数据存储在澳大利亚并不一定保证安全。”“澳大利亚网络安全中心和一家私人公司之间的秘密讨论已经由信号局和网络安全中心工作了多年，就像所有最终获得保护地位的公司一样。”f ASD要求提供者在澳大利亚是CSCSL批准的，Miggbon说“不一定”。“这取决于体系结构，它取决于体系结构中的缓和，以及政策和程序——我澄清它是很重要的，因此它不是。他说：“黑色和白色，就像有些人所描绘的那样。”我很满意，微软的Azure云作为认证的所有意图和目的都符合其他公司所要求的所有标准。风险减轻了，我很满意。我很满意，澳大利亚政府的风险，相对于你提到的特定云提供商来说，已经很好地满足了。
Australia's Cyber Coordinator Alastair MacGibbon, facing Senate Estimates in his policy capacity that reports to the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs, has said he is confident the data on Australians is safe in the hands of Microsoft, despite the Washington headquartered company having staff scattered around the globe.Microsoft in April received accreditation from the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), allowing it to store Protected-level certification for cloud services is currently the highest security level approved by the ASD on its Certified Cloud Services List (CCSL).Microsoft became the second international player awarded the certification, and the fifth on the CCSL, with Prior to this, Microsoft in June received At the time, Microsoft Azure engineering lead for Australia James Kavanagh, as the company's Australian national technology officer, was asked by ZDNet how the local arm of the company intended to receive protected-level certification as one of the requirements of such accreditation requires the company have all staff and datacentres located within Australian boundaries.Kavanagh said there were services "coming downstream" to allow government organisations to "go beyond" just the unclassified data route.Redmond's classification, in part, comes via a Facing Senate Estimates on Tuesday, MacGibbon was asked by Australian Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John whether the information stored on the Australian instance of the Microsoft Azure Cloud will be able to be accessed by overseas staff."I am satisfied that Microsoft Azure, in its protected form as certified by the Signals Directorate -- or the Australian Cyber Security Centre within the Signals Directorate -- will be stored in Australia," MacGibbon told the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on Tuesday."Data can reside anywhere in the world, you can demand data stay in Australia but it doesn't always make it more secure that it's in a particular geography ... it's good that we hold data in Australia, that means that data comes under Australian law, that means that agencies and others have more access to it and other country's agencies theoretically don't have access to that data."MacGibbon, refusing to answer specifically if Microsoft staff overseas could access data located in Australia, said he is satisfied that the Microsoft staff that will have access to data will be "appropriately cleared"."I'm satisfied that Microsoft will be storing data in Australia but just because data is stored in Australia doesn't necessarily make it secure," he continued."There are confidential discussions between the Australian Cyber Security Centre and a private company that has been worked with for years by the Signals Directorate and the Cyber Security Centre, as it does with all companies that eventually receive protected status."When asked specifically if the ASD requires the provider to be based in Australia to be CSSL approved, MacGibbon said "not necessarily"."It depends on the architecture and it depends on the mitigations in place in an architecture, and the policies and procedures -- it's important that I clarify it -- therefore it's not as black and white as some people would portray it," he said."I am satisfied that for all intents and purposes the Microsoft Azure Cloud as certified meets all of the standards required, that are met by the other companies."There is no particular prescribed way to meet those standards, so long as the risk is mitigated, I'm satisfied. And I'm very satisfied that the risk to the Australian government, in relation to the particular cloud provider you're referring to, is well-met."
