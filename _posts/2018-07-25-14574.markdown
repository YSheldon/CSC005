(Image: file photo)Confusion swirled after a report claimed last week that file storage service Dropbox had given away data on thousands of academics.The researchers claimed they could see "every Dropbox folder associated with a given researcher."In case you missed it, the highlights of a research study by Northwestern University The researchers initially claimed Dropbox gave them raw data, which they anonymized, but their report was updated Dropbox said It's a confusing situation -- and one that has academics Several We contacted Adam Pah and Brian Uzzi, who authored the article, prior to publication, who later responded through a public relations firm, saying: "There was no data privacy issue.""Before providing researchers the data and to protect users' privacy, Dropbox anonymized the data by rendering any identifying user information permanently indecipherable. The article now clarifies this issue," said the resesarchers' joint statement.Given there were few concrete answers and concerns about misinformation from all sides, we reached out to Dropbox earlier today to relay some of the issues that aggrieved the academics.We asked Dropbox to respond "on the record" to about a dozen questions. Dropbox offered a background briefing -- which would effectively prevent Dropbox asked we print their answers in full -- which we have in quotes below. In explaining how data was shared in the first place, Dropbox said:In other words, anyone with a Dropbox account consented by virtue of accepting the privacy policy. Granted, Dropbox isn't the first company to share its vast stores of anonymized data with academics But even anonymized data We also asked how the apparently incorrect report was published in the first place.The paper was co-bylined by Rebecca Hinds, Dropbox's own enterprise insights manager, and was also posted in a shorter post on Dropbox said: Efforts to contact Hinds were unsuccessful; she had deleted her Twitter and LinkedIn accounts earlier this week. We also contacted Julia Poncela-Casasnovas, a Northwestern postdoctoral fellow, who said Although she could not answer many of the questions we put to Dropbox, Poncela-Casasnovas confirmed a formal correction to the report was being drafted."I can however confirm that none of us at Northwestern ever saw the non-anonymized Dropbox data," she said. "Also, I was the one who did most of the analysis for this research while working at Brian Uzzi's lab."The report said the researchers were able to see information about "every Dropbox folder" tied to any given researcher and how often the folder was accessed by anyone associated with it -- but Poncela-Casasnovas refuted that in an email to "As I said, the data was anonymized and aggregated before they gave it to us. This means there was no way of reverting it to know who the subjects were," she said."Dropbox added:"The study began in 2016 and used anonymized data from May 2015 to May 2017. Dropbox used a combination of aggregated sharing activity as well as publicly available information provided by NICO to generate a dataset of 16,000 researchers for the study.""No researcher, at Dropbox or [Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems], had access to any user content at any time. For this project, the Dropbox researcher had restricted access to a limited subset of metadata that was relevant to the study. This access was audited and reviewed by our security team." Dropbox did not answer some of our questions: Were free, paid, or business accounts affected? How did Dropbox determine if an anonymized account belonged to a researcher? And, are any other research projects currently underway by Dropbox or its partners?It's yet another reminder that companies collect and store but also generate tons of data on its customers -- simply by offering the service -- and that their privacy policies often allow them to doalmost anything they want with it.As much as file sharing and collaborative sites are helpful for researchers to share ideas and data, you're often at the mercy of the company's privacy policy.You can send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755Â–8849.
