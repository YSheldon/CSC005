Google has announced today a new security mechanism for Pixel 2 smartphones, for which, in the near future, it would be impossible to update or replace the phone's firmware without entering the user's password.Google says it added this new security mechanism as a way to prevent malicious insiders, even those with the highest level of access, from tampering with its smartphones.This new security measure is just the cherry on top of an already super-secure device that even today comes with plenty of low-level firmware protections.For example, Pixel devices use secure hardware components to store and handle the encryption keys used for encrypting the user's locally-stored data.This "secure hardware" also runs its own set of secure firmware that checks the validity of the user's password and also protects the device from repeated attempts to guess a password (brute-force attacks).This firmware is also protected by a code signing mechanism to prevent attackers from replacing the firmware altogether with one that bypasses password checks and just decrypts the data, no questions asked.Here's where Google's new security feature comes in handy. By requiring a phone's password when replacing or updating this firmware, Google is making sure that an attacker has to compromise both the firmware's digital signature process and the user's device password at the same time. Compromising one is hard enough, but compromising both is near impossible.It's a small update on Google's part, but one with great repercussions to device security. Sure, hacking a Pixel 2 phone was hard anyway, but not it just got many times harder.
