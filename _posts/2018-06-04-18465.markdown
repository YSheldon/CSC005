At Zebra Technologies, our global information security strategy is to provide security visibility thats visionary. We empower employees to do what they need to do with the freedoms enabled by mobile and cloud computing, while maintaining visibility into their computing assets so we can keep them and our business interests secure.Our cybersecurity tools provide the visibility. We place agents and monitoring software onto employees computers so theyre free to go wherever they need to go. No matter where they are, no matter what they do, we can protect them.To make this approach work, our security staff must understand our organization, its business and its goals, and to make sure security is a part of the puzzle, not an outlier. And we also work closely with our IT team to make sure that programs are delivered and operating in a secure manner. In doing so, our security team has become a department of yes that helps our business achieve both its goals and a reasonable level of security.Essentially, our security and IT departments have become business partners, and having security tools that can do more than just security is an important part of that relationship.The CrowdStrikeŽ FalconŽ platform is a great example of this concept, because its more than just a security tool that safeguards our systems and staff. Its also a vital operational tool for our IT team.For example, the Falcon platform provides visibility into our assets  what operating systems are being used, what software versions are running, things like that. It helps us from an asset inventory and management perspective.Of the numerous ways the Falcon platform benefits Zebra Technologies, the following are key:To integrate cybersecurity into the broader IT department with the aim of enabling business, might I suggest the following:The benefits of this visionary visibility security approach extend to customer relationships and add market value to the company, as well, because it can enable a business to expand and try new technologies.At the end of the day, having a security platform that can do more than just security is a benefit to the entire organization. Were all here to make sure that Zebra Technologies succeeds, and that we have the right tools in place to do so.Prior to co-founding CrowdStrikeŽ, I was probably best known in the business world as one oftttttttttttttttttttttWe started CrowdStrike five years ago with the mission to revolutionize endpoint security.
