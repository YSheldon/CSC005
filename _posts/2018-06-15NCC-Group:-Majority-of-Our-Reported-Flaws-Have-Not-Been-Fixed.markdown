Medium-risk and then critical vulnerabilities followed, taking 77 days and 74 days respectively.NCC Group complained that too often vendors lack a clear point of contact for researchers to communicate with when they find a flaw, lengthening the delay. Sometimes out of desperation, researchers are even forced to contact the vendor’s social media team in order to find a secure communication channel, it added.NCC Group research director, Matt Lewis, bemoaned the lack of established processes for vulnerability remediation and disclosure. Just 2.4% of the vulnerabilities found by his team and reported resulted in a CVE.“There also seems to be a false sense of security among businesses when it comes to low-risk vulnerabilities. These are vulnerabilities nonetheless, and we’re seeing an increase in bug chaining attacks, which exploit multiple low-risk issues across infrastructure to achieve full, unauthorized control of the underlying system,” he added.“The fact that the majority of vulnerabilities uncovered by our researchers over the past nine years have not been fixed demonstrates that there are likely far more zero-day vulnerabilities in existence than we might think.”Separate research The WannaCry ransomware campaign of May 2017 highlighted just how many organizations fail to patch even critical bugs promptly.
