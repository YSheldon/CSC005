The report also identifies goals that are intended to help mitigate risks associated with botnets and to increase the resilience of the internet ecosystemtttttttttttttttThe United States’ Department of Homeland Security and Department of Commerce have released a joint report aimed at identifying actions to reduce threats posed by Called Based on the various facets of the botnet menace, the report identifies five goals that are intended to help mitigate the risk of attacks unleashed by botnets and to make the internet ecosystem more resilient. The objectives involve determining a clear pathway toward a secure technology marketplace, promoting innovation both in the infrastructure that underlies the digital ecosystem and in the networking industry, promoting cooperation between various stakeholders, and boosting awareness of the threats.ESET Senior Malware Researcher Meanwhile, the report also dispenses guidance for providers at the infrastructure level, which includes “the hardware, software, tools, standards, and practices on which the ecosystem depends – for example, routers, switches, Internet service providers, DNS providers, content delivery networks, hosting and cloud-service providers”. Organizations operating in this space should work towards understanding the benefits of shared-defense approaches and work towards driving best-practice adoption.A large portion of the report deals with edge devices, which it defines as “personal computers, mobile devices, edge servers, and IoT and other connected devices” and which can act as both the sources and victims of attacks.Security is often an afterthought in the design of especially “Over the years, the targets have evolved, ranging from business machines, to poorly secured home devices, to vulnerable systems run by hosting providers and cloud service providers, and, more recently, to IoT devices,” reads the report. With that in mind, the report advocates establishing internationally applicable baselines both for home and industrial IoT applications. It calls for global advances in the domain of edge devices that will be underpinned by robust and universally accepted and deployed standards, specifications, and security practices, such as secure default configurations and effective software update mechanisms. By elevating security to a primary design requirement, the devices would be less vulnerable to compromise at any point throughout their lifecycles.However, a risk also emanates from systems that are no longer supported by their manufacturers and so their vulnerabilities are difficult to address. The threat involving legacy systems is further compounded by the heavy use of pirated software by many enterprises in many countries, as security holes in the software are never patched and the systems using them remain vulnerable to compromise.The report came out at a time when it emerged that hundreds of thousands of routers had been compromised with
