"But even so, the number of attacks will only decrease temporarily," said Onur Cengiz, head of the Link11 security operation center. "Experience has shown in recent years that for every DDoS attack marketplace taken out, multiple new platforms will pop up like the heads of a hydra."A According to the Kaspersky Lab DDoS report, Q1 revealed an increased number of DDoS attacks and targets, but there are distinctions among the different attack methods. “Amplified” attacks were beginning to wane but had a bit of a boost in momentum, while network time protocol (NTP) and DNS-based boosting had almost disappeared after most vulnerable services were patched.DDoS attacks as a means of personal revenge grew more popular in Q1 2018. Also trending were Memcached attacks that resemble a typical DDoS attack; however, according to the Kaspersky report, “Cybercriminals will likely seek out other non-standard amplification methods besides Memcached.”As server owners patch vulnerabilities, there will be dips in certain types of attacks. “That being the case, DDoS masterminds will likely seek out other amplification methods, one of which could be LDAP services,” the Kaspersky report authors wrote.
