可口可乐公司本周公布了一个数据泄露事件，此前一名雇员在个人硬盘上发现了工人数据。去年九月，执法官员接触了Coca-Cola后，该公司获悉了安全漏洞。一家可口可乐子公司的劳埃里发现了一个外部硬盘，包含了从Coca-Cola中挪用的信息。可口可乐说，它在过去几个月里与执法部门合作，调查数据的来源和有效性，并确定一些数据。文件中包含了一些员工的个人信息。根据国家法律，该公司现在向受影响雇员发送通知信。“我们正在向大约8000名个人信息发布数据泄露通知，这些个人信息包含在前一个EMP的计算机文件中。当他离开公司的时候，他和他在一起，“一位可口可乐发言人告诉被盗和暴露的数据的类型每个员工都不一样，”发言人告诉我们，“我们非常重视信息安全，我们对每个人的信息都很有兴趣。“我们很抱歉，任何不便或担心，这可能会导致他们，”发言人补充说。我们没有任何信息表明信息是用来识别身份盗窃的。“可口可乐通过一个第三方供应商为受影响的雇员提供一年的免费身份监控。该公司还补充说，它一直等到现在才向员工报告违反规定。目前仍在调查这起事件的执法人员。可口可乐公司并不是第一个将其数据暴露在前雇员的大公司。SunTrase'遭受了一个额外的打击，有很多类似的不满的员工对以前的公司造成了损害，我们以前曾报道过。
