That’s understandable, given the WannaCry attack of May 2017 devastated large parts of the NHS, leading to an estimated 19,000 cancelled operations and appointments.Worryingly, over a quarter (26%) of respondents claimed they don’t have an incident response plan in place — something required by the new GDPR.In addition, 28% said their healthcare organization (HCO) doesn’t even have chief information security officer (CISO).A recent report from Answering questions on the insider threat, respondents to the Imperva poll said they were most concerned about careless users (51%). While 27% claimed a lack of tools to monitor employees and other activities makes detecting insider threats difficult.“Attackers understand the value of the data held by healthcare organizations, and as a result, they are quickly becoming a sweet spot for hackers looking to steal large amounts of patient records for profit,” argued “There have been a number of incidents recently where cybercrime has impacted hospitals and left them unable to access patient data, which demonstrates the consequences of a successful attack. It is crucial that healthcare organizations take steps to protect their data. To retain patient trust, organizations must provide an excellent defense at all times.”
