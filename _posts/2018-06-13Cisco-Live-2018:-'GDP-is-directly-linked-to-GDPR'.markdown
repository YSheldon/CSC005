思科首席隐私官Michelle Dennedy告诉ZDNET。随着新货币的出现，经济增长将直接与数据的保护相联系。Dennedy在奥兰多思科Live 2018期间说，影响隐私的最大问题是：“我们真的很担心我们有SIMABI。”我们的全球经济环境的灵活性；经常，当你有经济动荡，人们认为他们可以开始掠夺的东西，如安全和隐私。“我不认为这是可能的，”她告诉ZDNet，“我认为国内生产总值或GDP将与GDPR之类的东西紧密相连，因为你的网络的完整性将是你数据的完整性。”据Dennedy说，GDP将越来越依赖于数据。与货币相比，她说隐私的保护同样是文化的。“我认为数据在这方面非常相似，我们想告诉我们的故事的方式，我们集体同意被监管的方式，或者与我们的政府、我们的企业和每个OT互动。她，甚至是跨代，都会改变未来，这就是为什么我认为它与GDP息息相关，“她解释说。”Dennedy说，“思科公司的每一个客户都在询问如何处理GDPR，并确保它们与法规保持一致。要弄清楚他们的数据在哪里以及他们将如何做。“如果你愿意的话，我们提供一种伙伴系统，所以我会和我的同龄人在我们的许多客户之间进行对等交流，并通过我们所经历的治理活动来讨论，”另一部分是ReA。LLY有时会为一些客户提供一个架构，他们中的大多数人都理解GDPR很容易被卷入这条法律中，在欧洲做生意或房屋客户或客户数据，很容易被抓住。“思科客户也有。在网络巨头已经与世界各地的公司进行了类似规定的情况下，丹尼迪表示，类似的原则在其他地方也存在，而且在亚太经合组织的27个成员国中，这一原则更为复杂。伊恩地区目前正在确保数据中心和欧洲仍然有足够的框架来互操作。“我们所做的是为跨境隐私规则框架或CBPR签署的，所以我们实际上是在我们去欧洲做GDPR之前开始的。欧洲的监管机构非常高兴地了解到，我们所做的是与我们的合作伙伴、我们的流程下游、我们的客户和我们的战略采取全球性的方法，因此我们正在研究GDPR的原理，而不一定是所有的具体实现。她解释道。不是所有的东西都是文化契合的，而是知道数据在哪里的基本原则，根据风险来均衡地保护它，然后理解你的治理模式是什么。“我认为GDPR在一天结束的时候，对文化和人来说就像技术一样，所以我们的技术。在所有这些碎片被放在一起之后就开始了。”
With data the new currency, economic growth will become directly linked to the protection of data, Cisco chief privacy officer Michelle Dennedy has told ZDNet.Speaking during Cisco Live 2018 in Orlando, Dennedy said the greatest issue affecting privacy "It really worries me that we have the instability of our global economic landscape; oftentimes, when you have economic upheaval, people think they can start skimping on things like security and privacy. I don't think that that is possible anymore," she told ZDNet."I think gross domestic product or GDP is going to be tightly linked to things like GDPR, because the integrity of your networks will be the integrity of your data."According to Dennedy, GDP will be increasingly dependent on data. Comparing it to currency, she said the protection of privacy is likewise cultural."I think data is very similar in that way, in that the way we want to tell our stories, the way we collectively have agreed to be policed or be interactive with our governments and with our businesses and with each other, and even cross-generation, is going to change going forward, and so that's why I think it is so bound up with GDP," she explained.Dennedy said "every single one" of Cisco's customers has been asking about how to deal with GDPR and ensure they remain in line with the regulations, with the first step to figure out where their data is and how they're going to do that."We provide sort of a buddy system, if you will, so I'll talk peer to peer with my peers at a lot of our customers, and talk through the governance activities that we've gone through," she said."And then the other piece is really putting together an architecture sometimes for some of these customers, most of whom understand the GDPR is very easy to get caught within that piece of legislation, doing business or housing customers or customer data in the European Union, it's easy to get caught."Cisco customers have also been reassured by the knowledge that the networking giant has actually worked with companies on similar regulations throughout the world -- Dennedy said similar principles are present elsewhere, and that it is far more complex in the 27 member economies for APAC.She said the trickiest thing in the Asian region right now is making sure datacentres there and in Europe still have enough framework to interoperate."What we've done is signed on for the cross-border privacy rules framework, or CBPR, and so we actually started there first before we went to Europe to do GDPR. And the regulators in Europe were very pleased to learn that what we were doing was really taking a global approach with our partners, with our processes downstream, with our customers and our strategy, so we're looking at the principles of GDPR, not necessarily all of the specific implementations," she explained. "Not everything is a cultural fit, but the primary principles of know where your data is, protect it proportionately according to risk, and then understanding what your governance model is."I think GDPR at the end of the day is as much about culture and people as it is technology, so our technology falls into place after all these pieces have been put together."
