The damage caused by these successful threats confirms the need to address cybersecurity,” the report reads.PA Consulting Group cited the following as trends that are increasing airports’ susceptibility to cyber-attacks: increased technology usage, hyper-connectivity, data-sharing obligations, customer centricity, IT/IoT towers, remote towers and airports as mega hubs.“Fundamentally, the focus on physical security needs to be applied with the same rigor in the cyber-arena if airports are going to build resilience to potentially catastrophic cyber-attacks,” said David Oliver, global transport security lead at PA Consulting Group. “If the industry does not act now, it will find itself at increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks as new technologies become part of everyday operations.”The report concludes by outlining the elements required to ensure airport cyber-resilience now and in the future:“With the EU Network and Information Systems Directive, which aims to improve the cyber-resilience of the UK’s essential services, now in force, UK airports risk penalties of up to £17m for failing to put in place appropriate cybersecurity measures,” Oliver added.
