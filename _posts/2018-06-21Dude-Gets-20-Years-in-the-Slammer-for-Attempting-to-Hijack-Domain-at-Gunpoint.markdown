一名爱荷华男子在试图在枪口劫持一个互联网域名之后，将在未来20年入狱，并被击毙，并被自己击毙。企图抢劫该域名的人是43岁的Sherman Hopkins Jr.，来自爱荷华锡达拉皮兹。受害者是Ethan Deyo，26岁，来自锡达拉皮兹，前GoDaD工程师，DoToFurtSt.com的所有者，这个事件的核心领域。根据法庭文件，2017年6月21日，霍普金斯强行进入Deyo的家，戴着帽子，头上系着裤袜，戴着墨镜。当Deyo向霍普金斯索要一个新域名的电子邮件地址和电话号码时，事情就失去了控制。霍普金斯的手枪没有提供所需的数据，而是在头上几次鞭打德奥，同时还拔出了一台泰瑟机，多次在他身上击鼓。不清楚霍普金斯为什么升级了这一事件，但当他翘起枪准备射击时，事情真的失去了控制。Deyo意识到了他身上的危险，转身把自己的枪从他头上挪开。在随后的争斗中，霍普金斯在腿上击毙了德奥，但后者成功地抓住了手枪并在胸前射杀了霍普金斯几次，然后与当地执法部门联系。霍普金斯在一个月后被指控，他于去年十二月认罪，接受了为期240个月的PRIS。在判决中，作为一项有罪答辩的一部分，威胁和暴力干涉和企图干涉商业。在判决之前，霍普金斯的妻子和两个孩子的母亲争辩说霍普金斯长期滥用物质的历史在他的行为中起了作用，但判决遵循WI。法庭文件没有透露为什么嫌疑犯想要这个域名，如果他想要它自己，或者被另一个人雇佣来获得域名所有权。doITFRESATE.COM域名直接引用了“为国家而做”、“网络迷因”和“流行H”这一短语。AsTag去年在爱荷华州立大学校园里流行起来。这个短语经常被学生们用来贴上他们自己或朋友的视频，或是他们的朋友们在网上发布恐怖、愚蠢的特技或裸体照片。在整个美国，仍然是一个活跃的标签，在社交网络上有无数新的帖子，如Twitter、Instagram、脸谱网或Snapchat。这个域名的所有者有可能在短语和Hash标签日益流行的情况下兑现。原来的域名在PH值之前是活跃的。2015年1月8日开始注册。根据
An Iowa man will go to prison for the next 20 years after he attempted to hijack an Internet domain at gunpoint, tased and shot the victim, and got shot back himself.The man who attempted the domain "robbery" is 43-year-old Sherman Hopkins Jr., from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The victim is Ethan Deyo, 26, also from Cedar Rapids, a former GoDaddy engineer, and the owner of doitforstate.com, the domain at the heart of this event.According to court documents, on June 21, 2017, Hopkins forcibly entered Deyo's home wearing a hat, pantyhose on his head, and dark sunglasses on his face.Things got out of control when Deyo asked Hopkins for an email address and telephone number for the domain's new ownership.Instead of providing the required data, Hopkins pistol whipped Deyo several times over the head, while also pulling out a taser and tasing Deyo multiple times on his arm, neck, and back.It is unclear why Hopkins escalated the event, but things really got out of control moments later when he cocked his gun, readying to fire.Deyo realized the danger he was in and turned his body to grab and move the gun from his head. In the struggle that followed, Hopkins shot Deyo in the leg, but the latter managed to get hold of the pistol and shoot Hopkins several times in the chest, before contacting local law enforcement.Hopkins was charged a month later, and he pleaded guilty in December last year, taking a 240-month prison sentence as part of a guilty plea to one count of interference and attempted interference with commerce by threats and violence.Before sentencing, Hopkins wife and mother of two children argued that Hopkins' long history of substance abuse played a role in his actions, but the judged followed with the agreed-upon sentence.Court documents do not reveal why the suspect wanted the domain, if he wanted it for himself, or was hired by another person to obtain the domain's ownership.The doitforstate.com domain is a direct reference to the phrase "Do It For State," an Internet meme and popular hashtag that became popular on the Iowa State University campus last year.The phrase was often used as a hashtag or spoken phrase by students who would post videos of themselves or their friends carrying out dares, stupid stunts, or nude pictures online.The frat-spawned phrase quickly became popular all across the US and is still an active hashtag with countless new postings on social networks such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or Snapchat.The owner of this domain had the possibility of cashing in on the phrase and hashtag's growing popularity.The original domain was active prior to the phrase becoming popular, being registered on January 8, 2015.
