For anybody who still isn't cognizant that we can play mp3's from Command line ,there's a package called "mpg123"(there are many more but I'm more comfy w. this)

Ex: 

sudo apt install mpg123
mpg123  /home/binnishah/Downloads/nsync_tearingup.mp3

To exit simply press ctrl + c https://t.co/2rmIXqyDka
