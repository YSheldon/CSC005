Despite a Experts say that one of the main reasons why spam still works is that users are still failing at recognizing spam. Users are having a hard time picking up spam despite spam being more than F-Secure With browsers and operating systems getting harder to hack via exploit kits and vulnerabilities, spam has been the safety net on which most cybercriminal operations have fallen on."Of the spam samples weve seen over spring of 2018, 46% are dating scams, 23% are emails with malicious attachments, and 31% contain links to malicious websites," said Päivi Tynninen, Threat Intelligence Researcher at F-Secure."Weve found that just five file types make up 85% of malicious attachments," Päivi added. "They are ZIP, .DOC, .XLS, .PDF, and .7Z."F-Secure says cybercriminals have not found in spam campaigns a novel and newly efficient infection method. Spam is as inefficient as it ever was, even despite its recently observed increased click rate."The technique still relies on spewing out massive numbers of emails in order to snare a tiny number of users," F-Secure said in its report.But despite the lowly click rate, spam still works better than all alternatives, and criminals are continually refining their tactics to deliver spam with better results.F-Secure says that the probability of a recipient opening a spam email increases with 12% if the email claims to come from a known individual.Having a subject line free from errors also improves a spam campaign's success rate by 4.5%, while phishing emails stating that they are very urgent get less traction than when the urgency is implied, rather than spelled out.These subtle wordings and email design tricks are now the frontline of the cyber-security industry. With "Weve reduced criminals to spam, one of the least effective methods of infection," Unless users are using a really old browser and OS, they can easily avoid getting infected with malware these days by learning to recognize spam when it slips through spam filters.
