A wave of sophisticated spear phishing emails captured by Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab suggests that the same Russian-linked hacking group responsible for a Dubbed the ÂSandworm GroupÂ by security analysts, the attackers gained notoriety earlier this year when a destructive hacking tool aimed at the IT network attached to the Winter Olympics caught the attention of multiple intelligence agencies. That tool, known as ÂOlympic Destroyer,Â allowed for malware to spread within multiple confined IT environments, quickly deleting boot records and other forensic artifacts while also simultaneously siphoning off sensitive user credentials.CyberScoopÂ One related phishing email that uses a booby trapped Microsoft Word document explicitly mentions a biochemical threat research conference held in Switzerland, which is organized by Spiez Laboratory. Kaspersky noticed the lure was being sent around last month. Other phishing emails incorporate fake letterheads associated with a Ukrainian government agency.The Olympics attacks became known for its use of so-called Âfalse flags,Â which injected a combination of technical attributes and techniques typically associated with an entirely different threat group in order to throw off investigators. At the time, Sandworm had been trying to pass off their operations as being carried out by North Korean hackers.According to prior reporting by NSA confirms Olympicdestroyer was Russia false flagging North KoreaÂ Chris Bing (@Bing_Chris) The latest findings by KasperskyÂ Â a company Researchers said they were able to connect the new phishing emails to prior OlympicDestroyer exploits with Âmoderate confidence.ÂWhile the newest, first-stage hacking attempts havenÂt proven to be destructive just yet, the use of spearphishing in order to gain access to computers in France, Germany, Switzerland, Russia, and Ukraine has already set off alarm bells. In these cases, the malicious emails carry PowerShell Empire, an open-source penetration testing framework, inside attachments that when clicked will begin to runÂ scripts, calling back to a remote attack server. The samples so far do not carry a final payload like Olympic Destroyer, although the activity is believed to be connected.ÂThe variety of financial and non-financial targets could indicate that the same malware was used by several groups with different interests,Â KasperskyÂs Global ResearchAnalysis Team (GReAT) wrote. ÂThis could also be a result of cyberattack outsourcing, which is not uncommon among nation state actors. On the other hand, the financial targets might be another false flag operation by an actor who has already excelled at this during the Pyeongchang Olympics to redirect researchersÂ attention.ÂThis would not be the first time that experts discovered a grey area betweenÂ RussiaÂs financial and espionage-focused cyber operations.Ben Read, a cyber-espionage analyst with cybersecurity firm FireEye, said that his firm has also been tracking the biochemical-focused phishing emails.ÂWe assess that the same actor who sent spear phishing emails to Olympic partners around January and February ahead of the event is behind these new lures,Â Read said. ÂIn the past, weÂve seen APT28 and APT29 [both Russian-linked hacking teams] reuse CNE (computer network exploitation) tools for not just foreign espionage, but domestic security purposes. For example, we saw In a
