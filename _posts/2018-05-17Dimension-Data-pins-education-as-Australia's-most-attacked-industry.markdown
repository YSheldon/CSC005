金融服务业经常被报道为澳大利亚最受攻击的行业，但从维度数据的报告中发现，教育现在占据了王冠。在澳大利亚针对教育部门的所有攻击中，26%的维度数据今天的安全威胁在范围和严重性上都有了扩展。当信息安全没有得到妥善处理时，现在可能有几百万甚至数十亿美元的风险。t“增加攻击的程度很可能是因为在大学、大学和学校等设施内部和更多的协作环境中，”THT“开放网络已经在澳大利亚校园里变得很普遍，但是无处不在的网络使他们成为网络犯罪的诱人目标。ALS——特别是因为高等院校经常拥有敏感的公司和国家信息。“教育的第二位是技术部门，维度数据报告，占17%；金融，是Austral多年来最受攻击的行业榜首。IA，在第三与13%。维度数据显示，技术部门的重要知识产权是竞争优势的首要目标，这使得该行业成为全球第二大受到攻击的行业。“这是所有地区的前五名，表明敌意的转变，”报告说。根据这份报告，金融服务业的“科技进步”使其处于“高风险”。它仍然是最有针对性的，但不是最受攻击的部门。政府部门占袭击总数的13%，制造业占12%。报告指出，“迫使企业披露，如果他们已经成功地攻击网络罪犯，是提高网络安全对话到董事会级别，”报告指出。NDB法案还将刺激更多的投资进入安全技术的使用，确保正确的平衡和风险保证，并巩固客户的信心。“如果你的公司还没有处理安全作为其高层次战略的一部分，我们建议把它作为一个当务之急。”据报道，虽然澳大利亚是一个经常性的目标，它也是一个主要的攻击源。去年，亚太地区（APAC）地区57%的网络攻击源于澳大利亚、美国和中国。据报道，亚太经合组织66%的金融攻击源于澳大利亚。报告说：“这些攻击通常是复杂的，以及目标服务、应用程序和Web应用程序。”TARE特定攻击在该地区最常见的攻击类型中排名第一，有28%；暴力强制跟随，25%；应用特定攻击占14%；另外4%的列表是拒绝服务或分发。拒绝服务攻击。“这是不足为奇的，因为澳大利亚采用先进技术，”报告继续。它拥有许多熟练的技术专业人员和无数的崭露头角的技术人员。这保证了该国仍然是一个巨大的目标，也是网络攻击的持续避风港。”该报告基于从NTT安全收集的全球攻击和事件响应数据，并支持从2016年10月1日到2017年9月30日的NTT运营公司。澳大利亚信息专员办公室在该计划运作的前六个星期收到了63条违反数据的通知。据报道，在不到六周的时间里，澳大利亚信息专员办公室报告了63起数据泄露事件，FireEye的MixAtdior已经警告该数字更高，但组织不确定其违约是否符合要求。南韩国和台湾也位列全球20大BOT交通量榜首，而中国则是第三个最常见的恶意流量来源，仅次于美国和俄罗斯。在亚太地区五个市场中，有一半的公司认为员工缺乏网络安全意识是最大的威胁，67%的人把内部威胁描述为组织的风险。T数据泄露可能是混乱的和充满压力的事件。学习你能采取的最有效的行动来帮助应对这些动荡的事件。
 tThe financial services sector is often reported as being the most attacked industry in Australia, but a report from Dimension Data has found education now holds the crown. tWith 26 percent of all attacks in Australia targeting the education sector, Dimension Data's Today's security threats have expanded in scope and seriousness. There can now be millions -- or even billions -- of dollars at risk when information security isn't handled properly. t"Increased levels of attacks are likely due to the move towards more collaborative environments inside and among facilities such as universities, colleges, and schools," thet"Open networks have become commonplace on Australian campuses, but that ubiquity makes them alluring targets for cybercriminals -- especially since higher learning institutions often possess sensitive company and state information." tSecond to education is the technology sector, Dimension Data reports, accounting for 17 percent; finance, which has been the top of the most attacked industry list for many years in Australia, came in third with 13 percent. tThe technology sector's significant intellectual property is a prime target for competitive advantage, Dimension Data said, making the sector the second most attacked, globally. t"It's in the top five across all regions, signalling a shift in adversary intentions," the report says. tAccording to the report, the "rising technology adoption" of the financial services sector places it at "elevated risk". It is still the most targeted, but not the most attacked sector. tThe government sector accounted for 13 percent of total attacks, while manufacturing accounted for 12 percent. tPointing to thet"Forcing companies to disclose if they've been successfully attacked by cybercriminals is elevating the cybersecurity conversation to the board level," the report notes. "The NDB Act will also spur more investment into security technology adoption, ensure the right balance and risk assurance, and reinstil customers' faith. t"If your company isn't yet dealing with security as part of its high-level strategy, we recommend making it an immediate priority." tWhile Australia is a frequent target, it's also a major source of attacks, according to the report. tIn the last year, 57 percent of cyberattacks in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region originated from Australia, the United States, and China. tIt was reported that 66 percent of attacks on the financial sector in APAC originated from Australia. t"These attacks are generally sophisticated and target services, applications, and web applications," the report says. tService-specific attacks topped the list of the types of attacks most commonly perpetrated in this region, with 28 percent; brute forcing followed, with 25 percent; application-specific attacks accounted for 14 percent; and further down the list with 4 percent was denial-of-service or distributed-denial-of-service attacks. t"This isn't surprising, given Australia's advanced adoption of technology," the report continues. "It has many skilled technology professionals and countless budding ones. This assures that the country will remain a massive target -- and continued haven -- for cyberattacks." tThe report is based on global attack and incident response data gathered from NTT Security and supported NTT operating companies from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017. t tThe Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has received 63 data breach notifications in first six weeks of the scheme's operation. t tAlthough 63 data breaches were reported to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in less than six weeks, FireEye's Mandiant has warned the figure is higher, but organisations are unsure if their breach fits the brief. t tSouth Korea and Taiwan also are on the top 20 list of global markets that saw the most bot traffic last year, while China was the third most common origin of malicious traffic, behind leader United States and Russia. t tAlmost half of companies across five Asia-Pacific markets view employees' lack of cybersecurity awareness as the biggest threat, with 67 percent describing internal threat as a risk the organisation. t tData breaches can be chaotic and stressful episodes.
