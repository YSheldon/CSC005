United States President Donald Trump is escalating the nation's trade war with China, preparing tariffs on a further $200 billion worth of Chinese imports as the Office of the US Trade Representative proposes 10 percent tariffs across 6,031 Chinese product lines.The office is accepting public submissions on the proposal, with hearings to be held between August 20 and August 23, after which a final decision will be made post-August 31, a senior administration official said.Trump has warned that he could tax up to $550 billion in Chinese products, exceeding the US' total imports from China during 2017.Republican Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch called the announcement on Tuesday "reckless" and untargeted."We cannot turn a blind eye to China's mercantilist trade practices, but this action falls short of a strategy that will give the administration negotiating leverage with China while maintaining the long-term health and prosperity of the American economy," Hatch argued.Trump last week similarly confirmed that punitive tariffs would be slapped on "You have another 16 in two weeks, and then as you know we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance," Trump said last week, referring to a previous threat that if China retaliates, Washington would raise duties on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods -- roughly half of China's exports to the US.According to research by Singapore's DBS Bank, an all-out trade war could shave off 0.25 percent of the GDP of both economies this year, with more damage expected in 2019.Trump had "We have a trade deficit, depending on the way you calculate, of $504 billion, now some people would say it is really $375 billion," Trump said at the time, adding that the tariffs could hit "Frankly, it's going to make us a much stronger, much richer nation."Trump's administration has also been cracking down on all Chinese involvement in the American tech sphere, including with The heads of the CIA, FBI, NSA, and the director of national intelligence to the Senate Intelligence Committee had also recommended in February that Americans Last week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was advised by the Executive Branch to Huawei similarly wrote to the FCC last week arguing that the Similar to its In addition to saying the US should not miss out on its leading 5G technology, Huawei again argued that there has The Trump Administration is considering setting standards for a Huawei's Australia CEO George Huang last week responded to calls for the technology giant to be barred from taking part in 5G rollouts due to concerns over sharing data with the Chinese government, telling ZDNet that the company "Huawei doesn't own, doesn't manage, doesn't operate any data," Huang told ZDNet."Huawei is just a network equipment vendor to the operators. Operators, they manage, they operate the network. The application of Huawei is to support our customers -- that means operators -- to build the system to manage those things."Huawei is just a vendor of the pipeline."
