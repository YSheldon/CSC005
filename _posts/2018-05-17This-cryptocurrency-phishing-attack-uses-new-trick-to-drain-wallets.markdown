一个热衷于利用安全支付系统比特币提供的潜在获利机会的犯罪集团有许多合法用途，但与其他技术一样，它也有益于网络罪犯寻求新的敲诈勒索手段。在用户登录到他们的密码学账户后几秒钟，他们就悄悄地和不可见地执行银行转账。研究人员指出，MyEtherWallet是攻击者的一个吸引人的目标，因为它使用起来很简单，但与其他银行相比，它缺乏安全性。交换使得它成为攻击的主要目标。一旦用户点击了MeWKIT页面，网络钓鱼攻击就开始进行，包括登录和被攻击者记录的钱包的私钥。之后，当受害者解密他们的钱包时，骗子就看漏了账号。SCAM使用脚本，通过像合法用户那样按下按钮自动创建资金转移，所有的活动都是隐藏的——这是第一次使用这种自动策略的攻击。“这个攻击说明了演员们是如何改变战术的。“目标是Survikurrices周围服务和实现的独特漏洞，”RISKIQ威胁研究者Yonathan Klijsnma说。MeWKIT结合了传统的网络钓鱼攻击和自动转移服务的功能，为一种定制的方式来清除MyEtherWallet的相对较低的障碍。“MeWKIT的后端允许攻击者监视已经收集了多少EAITUM。作为保持私人用户密钥和密码的记录，它可能被用于进一步的攻击。MeWKIT背后的那些人似乎已经活跃了一段时间，并进行了一些复杂的活动。研究人员说，MewKit展示了“来自威胁行动者的新的致力于追求隐秘性”的努力，这项运动“非常有利可图，并将在可预见的将来继续运作”。研究人员还无法确定犯罪组织或组织背后的组织。CKS，但是在重定向钱包中涉及的一些IP地址的位置表明操作是“一个熟悉的财务术语的母语为俄语的人”。为了避免这种形式的攻击，RiskIQ敦促所有MyEtherWallet用户在使用时使用警告。这个平台。“请密切关注你打开的URL，最好是为MyEtherWallet打一个书签页面，或者自己输入域名，”报告警告说，这也告诉用户不要使用声称是通过电子邮件或社交媒体发送的服务的链接。
A criminal group keen to take advantage of the potentially lucrative opportunities offered by Secure payment system Bitcoin has many legitimate uses, but like other technologies, it's also been beneficial to cybercriminals seeking new ways to extort money.Dubbed MEWKit by The attack injects scripts into active web sessions and silently and invisibly executes bank transfers just seconds after the user logs into their cryptocurrency account.Researchers note that MyEtherWallet is an appealing target for attackers because it is simple to use, but its lack of security compared to other banks and exchanges make it a prominent target for attack.Once the user hits a MEWKit page, the phishing attack gets underway with credentials including logins and the private key of the wallet being logged by the attackers.After that, the crooks look to drain accounts when the victim decrypts their wallet. The scam uses scripts which automatically create the fund transfer by pressing the buttons like a legitimate user would, all while the activity remains hidden -- it's the first time an attack has been seen to use this automated tactic."This attack demonstrates how actors are changing their tactics to target the unique vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency's surrounding services and implementations," said Yonathan Klijsnma, threat researcher at RiskIQ. "MEWKit combines the tactics of both traditional phishing attacks and the functionality of an [automated transfer service] for a tailor-made way to clear the relatively low barriers of MyEtherWallet."The back end of MEWKit allows the attackers to monitor how much Ethereum has been collected, as well as keeping a record of private user keys and passwords which can potentially be used for further attacks.Those behind MEWKit appear to have been active for some time and have carried out some sophisticated campaigns. Researchers say MewKit demonstrates a "new dedicated effort from threat actors to pursue cryptocurrency" and that the campaign is "highly lucrative and will continue to be in operation for the foreseeable future".Researchers haven't been able to pin down the criminal group or groups behind the attacks, but the location of some of the IP addresses involved in the redirection of wallets suggests that the operation is "by a native Russian speaker who is familiar with financial terms".In order to avoid falling for this form of attack, RiskIQ urges all MyEtherWallet users to use caution when using the platform."Please keep a very close eye on which URL you open, and, preferably, have a bookmarked page for MyEtherWallet or type the domain name yourself," warns the report, which also tells users not touse links claiming to be the service that have been sent via email or social media.
