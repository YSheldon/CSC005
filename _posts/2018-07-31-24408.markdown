"We have identified certain companies that do not operate in a way consistent with what we have for defense standards."Chinese telecoms firm It really speaks to cybersecurity writ large, which is one of our greatest concerns right now," Terry Ray, CTO at It is common for the US government to scan software used in its environments for backdoors and other embedded code, or configurations that may allow hidden or previously unidentified connections, inbound or outbound to the technology, he said.At the moment, I have not seen details on any new inspection processes which makes me think the technical review will utilize existing techniques. However, its important to note that other well-developed countries operate similarly and prefer to purchase and implement in-country or open source technology, in lieu of off-the-shelf products offered by the US or its allies.
