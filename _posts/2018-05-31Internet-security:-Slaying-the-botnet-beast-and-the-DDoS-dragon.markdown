根据美国政府的一份报告，提高设备安全性、改善基础设施公司之间的协调以及企业的更聪明采购都是解决僵尸网络威胁的一部分。处理DDoS的方法有效地涉及到网络提供商在超额容量中吸收攻击的影响。然而，这些事件的规模已经扩大到每秒超过一兆字节，远远超出预期的规模和过剩的产能。除此之外，处理DDoS的标准方法无法阻止僵尸网络的其他用途，例如传播勒索软件。僵尸网络增加了国土安全部的报告，商务部强调了需要做的一些改变。基础设施提供商应该分享更多关于威胁演变的数据，特别是对规模较小、资金不足、或利基的玩家——看看从IPv6转移到什么好处，报告说。企业需要隔离遗留设备和其他不能安全的设备，部署ON和OFF的DDoS缓解服务，并重新考虑它们的网络架构。工业和执法部门应该努力找到更多的方法来协调和更早地发现和防止威胁活动，并管理发生的事件。但是报告的最大部分涉及设备、个人电脑、智能手机和物联网设备的威胁。通常是在没有安全考虑的情况下设计的。开发人员要么不知道好的安全设计实践，要么假定设备将无法访问（例如，在无法从因特网上访问的本地网络），或者希望避免带来额外成本、增加市场时间或使设备更难消费者的安全解决方案。使用。由此产生的设计选择，如硬编码的管理密码，创建固有的不安全设备。在其他情况下，适当的安全控制是存在的，但可用性和用户界面导致了不太安全的配置。”该报告指出，软件开发的结果是——乐观地——每2000行代码中的一个缺陷，其中许多缺陷会产生可利用的安全漏洞。利兹。虽然现代服务器、台式机、笔记本电脑和智能手机提供的妥协机会明显减少，但新类设备的情况并非如此。这些系统现在提供了最具吸引力的目标给恶意行动者，并且在生态系统中的设备越来越大，“报告警告说，另一个问题是，现代设备并不是唯一连接到互联网的：许多传统服务器、台式机、笔记本电脑和MO。今天使用的胆汁不再被制造商所支持，因此他们的脆弱性很难得到解决。软件盗版在中国可以高达70%，制造商通常会限制安全补丁的分发到运行合法购买软件的系统，因此这些系统无法抵御已知的漏洞。报告说，所有这些都需要改变。设备必须能够抵御整个部署生命周期中的攻击——在装运时、使用期间和结束时。要做到这一点，安全性必须成为主要的设计要求。供应商不能装运具有已知严重安全缺陷的设备，必须包括安全更新机制，并且必须遵循最佳的当前实践（例如，没有硬编码的密码，禁用对操作不重要的软件特性）用于系统配置和管理。供应商应该披露对客户的支持的最小持续时间，设备制造商应该为承诺的持续时间保持安全更新服务。“但是，该报告承认，目前的技术经济工作对安全性：”市场激励似乎加剧了T。他有问题。产品开发者优先考虑市场的时间和创新的功能，而不是安全性和弹性。安全特性不容易理解或传达给消费者，这就很难产生需求。”报告说，变革可能始于企业购买者，或许乐观地认为：“更好的安全性的价值主张很可能始于企业环境由于其规模经济，一旦有一个普遍接受的安全姿态在一个给定的产品类别，很少有制造商可能会忽略它。
Improving device security, better coordination between infrastructure companies, and smarter procurement by businesses are all part of tackling the botnet menace, according to a US government report.The snappily titled Botnets and the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks they deliver Traditional ways of dealing with DDoS effectively involved network providers building in excess capacity to absorb the impact of an attack. However, these incidents have grown in size to more than one terabit per second, far outstripping expected size and excess capacity. On top of this, standard ways of dealing with DDoS are unable to stop other uses of botnets, such as spreading ransomware. And as botnets add The report from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Commerce highlights a number of changes that need to be made. Infrastructure providers should share more data about evolving threats -- especially with smaller, less well-funded, or niche players -- and see what benefits come from a move to IPv6, the report said. Enterprises need to isolate legacy devices and other devices that cannot be secured, deploy on- and off-premise DDoS mitigation services and rethink their network architectures. Industry and law enforcement should work to find ways to coordinate more often and earlier to detect and prevent threat activity, and to manage incidents that take place.But the biggest section of the report deals with the threat from devices -- PCs, smartphones and IoT devices which, it said, have often been designed without security in mind. "Developers are either unaware of good security design practices, assume that the device will be inaccessible (e.g., on a local network inaccessible from the Internet), or want to avoid security solutions that impose additional cost, increase time to market, or make a device harder for consumers to use. The resulting design choices, such as hard-coded administrative passwords, create inherently insecure devices. In other cases, appropriate security controls are present but usability and user interfaces result in less-secure configurations."The report noted that software development result in -- optimistically -- a flaw every 2,000 lines of code, and many of these flaws create exploitable security vulnerabilities. Although modern servers, desktops, laptops, and smartphones offer significantly fewer opportunities for compromise, this is not the case with new classes of device."IoT devices are often sorely lacking in security-focused features. These systems now offer the most attractive target to malicious actors, and are an increasingly large percentage of the devices in the ecosystem," the report warned.Another problem is that modern devices are not the only ones connected to the internet: many legacy servers, desktops, laptops, and mobile phones in use today are no longer supported by their manufacturers, so their vulnerabilities cannot be easily addressed. Software piracy can run as high as 70 percent in China, and manufacturers typically restrict the distribution of security patches to systems running legally purchased software, so these systems cannot be secured against known vulnerabilities. All of this needs to change, the report said. "Devices must be able to resist attacks throughout their deployment lifecycles -- at the time of shipment, during use, and through to end-of-life. For this to occur, security must become a primary design requirement. Vendors must not ship devices with known serious security flaws, must include a secure update mechanism, and must follow best current practices (e.g., no hard-coded passwords, disabling software features that are not critical to operation) for system configuration and administration. Vendors should disclose the minimum duration of support to customers, and device manufacturers should maintain secure update services for the promised duration."However, the report acknowledged that at the moment the economics of tech work against security: "Market incentives appear to exacerbate the problem. Product developers prioritize time to market and innovative functionality over security and resilience. Security features are not easily understood or communicated to the consumer, which makes it difficult to generate demand." The report said that change could start with the enterprise buyer, and -- perhaps optimistically -- argued: "The value proposition for better security will likely start in the enterprise environment due to its economies of scale; once there is a generally accepted security posture in a given product class, few manufacturers would be likely to ignore it."
