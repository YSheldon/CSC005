The third wave is around autonomous networks, which is not expected to hit the market for several years.The Kubernetes platform is based on the container orchestrators 1.10 release, which SNAPS-Kubernetes will initially limit support to Docker-based containers because Docker is the most widely used container platform. Levensalor noted that it could add support for SNAPS-Kubernetes can be run on an existing virtual platform. CableLabs continuous integration scripts use the SNAPS-OO product to automate the installation on an OpenStack platform.CableLabs launched the SNAPS effort late last year as a way to fill in gaps within open source to ease the adoption of SDN and NFV for its cable members. Its basically a virtualized service core based on an OpenStack foundation and using OpenStack code directly rather than a vendor distribution. It also uses Open vSwitch and the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK).That initial work was on the SNAPS-OO software development code that was eventually transferred to the SNAPS-Boot is designed to prepare a network operators servers for OpenStack. The SNAPS-OpenStack installer brings up OpenStack on running servers.With a single command, you can install Linux on your servers and prepare them for your OpenStack installation, Levensalor explained in a Dan Meyer is a Senior Editor at SDxCentral, with a focus on containers, lifecycle service orchestration, cloud automation and DevOps.
