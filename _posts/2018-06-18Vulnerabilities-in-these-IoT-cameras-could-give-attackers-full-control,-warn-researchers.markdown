近400种由一个制造商连接的网络摄像机的漏洞可能允许攻击者将设备的远程控制用作监视工具，并能够窥探其录制的任何音频或视频。来自漏洞的RAS已经被披露到AXIS，它已经更新了相机中总共七个漏洞的固件被发现，并且研究人员已经详细说明了如何将它们中的三个链接在一起以提供远程访问相机并执行远程SH。这包括提供对摄像机的视频流的访问，控制摄像机在何处寻找的能力，以及控制运动检测和听音频的能力。在这种情况下，也有可能利用相机作为更广泛攻击的网络入口点，也有可能将相机带入恶意僵尸网络。“导致root访问漏洞的威胁如此之大，是攻击者吗？“Vooo的Asaf Karas创始人和CTO告诉ZDNET。”如果有合适的资源，如果有人知道这些漏洞在被修补之前很长一段时间，他或她肯定会侵犯个人的隐私和组织的安全。Y以显著的方式；也可以使用许多受影响的相机攻击其他目标。随着IOT设备越来越成为真实、物理世界的一部分，需要在避免对连接系统进行网络攻击的情况下避免灾难发生。“AXIS强烈建议终端用户以受控的方式更新受影响的轴产品的固件。为了高效地部署升级后的固件，轴心建议使用工具轴设备管理器，它将持续监控和通知可用的固件，”该公司在一份声明中说。那些尚未更新相机的人建议立即“立即”这样做。这远不是第一次在IP摄像机中发现关键漏洞——而就在上周，研究人员已经发现
Vulnerabilities in almost 400 models of internet connected video camera by one manufacturer could allow attackers to take remote control of devices for use as a surveillance tool with the ability to snoop on any audio or video it recorded.By exploiting vulnerabilities in the internet-connected cameras from The vulnerabilities have been disclosed to Axis, which has updated the firmware of In total seven vulnerabilities in the cameras were discovered and researchers have detailed how three of them could be chained together in order to provide remote access to the cameras and execute remote shell commands with root privileges.These include providing access to the camera's video stream, the ability to control where the camera is looking and to control motion detection and the ability to listen to audio. There's also the potential for cameras exploited in this way to be used as an entry point in the network for a wider attack, as well as the possibility of the camera being roped into a malicious botnet."The reason that vulnerabilities that enable root access are so threatening, is that the attacker can practically use any feature of the camera and beyond," Asaf Karas founder and CTO of VDOO told ZDNet."With the right resources, if someone knows of such vulnerabilities for a long time before they are patched -- he or she could definitely violate individual's privacy and organization's security in a significant manner; and also could attack other targets using many of the affected cameras". Axis published With IoT devices increasingly a part of the real, physical world, something needs to be done to avoid disaster in the event of a cyberattack against connected systems."Axis strongly recommends end users to update firmware for affected Axis products in a controlled manner. To cost efficiently deploy the upgraded firmware, Axis recommends using the tool Axis Device Manager, which will continuously monitor and notify of available firmware," the company said in a statement.Those who've not yet updated their camera are advised to do so "immediately" by researchers.This is far from the first time critical vulnerabilities have been discovered in IP cameras -- and just last week The researchers have
