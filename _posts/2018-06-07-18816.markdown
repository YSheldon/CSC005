ÂI think the biggest issue is showing people that there are good jobs here. At the moment itÂs easier to offer anonymous hacking services on the dark web.ÂAlthough Lyne admitted his career has been Âfilled with lucky interventions,Â heÂs working hard to ensure the next generation of cyber-enthusiasts donÂt have to rely on luck to carve out a successful future in the industry.He bemoaned the lack of focus in learning on understanding how things work, claiming modern tech professionals perhaps rely too much on off-the-shelf tools.ÂWe need to rebuild that Ârip it apartÂ culture,Â said Lyne. ÂThe level of understanding of how tech works has dropped off a cliff. Technology is just so usable out of the box.ÂThe governmentÂs CyberFirst scheme, which Lyne was instrumental in developing, aims to achieve this by using gamification techniques to encourage more kids into the industry.
