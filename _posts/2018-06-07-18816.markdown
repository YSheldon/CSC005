At the moment its easier to offer anonymous hacking services on the dark web.Although Lyne admitted his career has been filled with lucky interventions, hes working hard to ensure the next generation of cyber-enthusiasts dont have to rely on luck to carve out a successful future in the industry.He bemoaned the lack of focus in learning on understanding how things work, claiming modern tech professionals perhaps rely too much on off-the-shelf tools.We need to rebuild that rip it apart culture, said Lyne. The level of understanding of how tech works has dropped off a cliff. Technology is just so usable out of the box.The governments CyberFirst scheme, which Lyne was instrumental in developing, aims to achieve this by using gamification techniques to encourage more kids into the industry.
