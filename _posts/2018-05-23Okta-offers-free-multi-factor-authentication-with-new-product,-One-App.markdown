OkTa星期三将推出一种新产品，称为小型组织的一个应用程序，或需要早期项目安全的组织——需要一个更经济实惠的进入OKTA的入口。一个应用程序采用Okta的企业级IT产品，并公开底层服务层，Al。Okta开发平台的前副总裁萨拉查向ZDNET解释。一个组织可以按照他们想要的方式组装这些产品。这些产品包括多因素认证、社会认证、集中身份管理等。萨拉查说：“我们正在尽一切努力给这些组织提供乐高块，他们需要马上组装这些东西，即使他们不是专家。”一个应用程序是免费的组织愿意显示OKTA标志时，他们的用户正在进行登记或认证。除了提升OKTA品牌，并进一步促进Okta对安全的承诺，免费版本也有助于推进一个应用程序的总体目标：说服组织跳过构建他们的安全层的过程。当你没有时间、资源或者员工的技能时，为什么要建立自己的用户管理系统呢？萨拉查问。通常，较小的IT团队会为他们的应用程序构建自定义的安全工具，萨拉查说。然后一年或两年后，当CIO想要解决整个组织的这个问题时，他们会去OKTA并撕毁他们已经建造的东西。我们正在试图打破这种建立与购买的模式。”
Okta on Wednesday is introducing a new product called One App for smaller organizations -- or organizations that need security for early-stage projects -- that need a more affordable entry point into Okta.One App takes Okta's enterprise-level IT products and exposes the underlying service layer, Alex Salazar, VP of Okta's developer platform, explained to ZDNet. An organization can assemble those products any way they want. Those products include multi-factor authentication, social authentication, centralized identity management and more. "We're doing our part to give these organizations the Lego blocks they need to assemble this stuff the right away, even if they're not experts in it," Salazar said. One App is free for organizations willing to display the Okta logo when their users are going through registration or authentication. In addition to elevating the Okta brand and furthering Okta's commitment to security, the free version also helps advance the overall objective of One App: Convincing organizations to skip the process of building their security layers. "Why build out your own user management system, when you don't have the time, resources or probably the skills on staff?" Salazar asked. Typically, smaller IT teams will build out custom security tools for their applications, Salazar said. "Then a year or two later, when the CIO wants to solve this problem across the organization, then they go to Okta and tear out what they've already built," he continued. "We're trying to disrupt that build versus buy model."
