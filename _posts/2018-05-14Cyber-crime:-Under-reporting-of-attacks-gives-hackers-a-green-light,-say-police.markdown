英国严肃而有组织的犯罪单位警告说，那些没有报告自己是网络犯罪受害者的组织正在使其他人面临进一步袭击的危险，并阻碍了当局打击黑客的能力。作为“数据泄露不足报告的一部分”的罪名继续侵蚀着我们对网络入侵的规模和成本进行稳健评估的能力，“报告说，”许多公司没有披露数据违规，使受害者处于危险之中。根据NCA所引用的数据，只有38%的人对执法能够正确应对“网络依赖”犯罪有信心，这意味着这部分是受害者未能报告他们遭受打击的部分原因。即使在报告网络犯罪时，警察可能发现自己无法定罪罪犯，因为“那些做报告的人有时可能不准备支持起诉，妨碍执法行动的能力”。对严重和有组织犯罪的国家战略评估表明，缺乏成功的网络犯罪报告意味着网络袭击者认为他们的行为没有后果。NCA还建议，法院经常向那些被判犯有黑客罪的人发放宽大的判决，尽管没有提供具体的例子。虽然法院承认犯罪的严重性，但通过的判决并不一定反映出这种严重性，而且可能显得很低。根据这份报告，各级网络犯罪计划继续对英国构成威胁，尽管这些组织中有许多在英国境外经营，但国内网络犯罪分子不可低估。报告警告说，来自英国国内网络犯罪分子的威胁继续成熟，这些国内行动者能够破坏袭击。几乎所有形式的网络犯罪都在上升，但国家犯罪机构指出，对英国企业来说特别危险的是，这些攻击需要更多的时间和资源来成功地进行黑客攻击，这可能是有利可图的。事实上，大量数据泄露的F也加剧了诈骗和网络钓鱼的增加，因为罪犯能够掌握敏感数据以帮助进行攻击。NCA指出，尽管如此，报告指出，尽管GDPR生效只有几周时间，但NCA有一点是肯定的，即网络犯罪和犯罪集团将继续瞄准英国。随着其地理范围的变化，比以往任何时候都显示出越来越协调的反应的要求，“NCA总干事Lynne Owens说：”与我们的执法、情报和其他合作伙伴一起工作，我们正在改变我们的运作方式，以确保T。他最大可能的影响。我们将利用这一情报评估来建立我们的业务成功和证据，证明为什么需要进一步投资能力和能力。
Organisations which don't report that they've been the victim of cyber crime are putting others at risk of further attacks and are hampering the authorities' ability to fight against hackers, the UK's serious and organised crime unit has warned.The National Crime Agency has issued the warning to businesses as part of its"Under-reporting of data breaches continues to erode our ability to make robust assessment of the scale and cost of network intrusions," said the report, adding "many companies are not disclosing data breaches, putting victims at risk". According to figures cited by the NCA, only 38 percent of people have confidence that law enforcement can properly respondent to 'cyber-dependent' crime, with the implication that this is partly why victims fail to report they've been hit. Even when cybercrime is reported, the police may find themselves unable to convict the perpetrators, because "those that do report may on occasion not be prepared to support prosecution, hampering the ability of law enforcement to act". The National Strategic Assessment of Serious and Organised crime suggests that the lack of successful cyber crime reporting means that cyber attackers believe that there's no consequences of their actions. This perception is also driven along by the courts often handing out lenient sentences to those convicted of hacking, the NCA suggests - although no specific examples of this are provided. "Whilst courts acknowledge the seriousness of the crimes committed, the level of sentence passed does not necessarily reflect this seriousness, and can appear low," said the report. According to the report, cyber criminal schemes at all levels continue to pose a threat to the UK, and while many of these groups are operating outside of UK borders, home-grown cyber criminals must not be underestimated. "The threat from UK domestic cyber criminals continues to mature, and these domestic actors are capable of damaging attacks," the report warns. Almost all forms of cyber crime are on the rise, but one the National Crime Agency points to as particularly dangerous for UK businesses is the rise of While these attacks take additional time and resources for hackers to successfully carry out, they can be lucrative. Indeed, the F The sheer number of large data breaches is also fuelling an increase in fraud and phishing, as criminals are able to get their hands on sensitive data to help carry out attacks. The NCA notes that withHowever, the report notes that despite there only being weeks to go until GDPR comes into force,But there's one thing the NCA points to as a certainty - that cybercriminals and crime groups will continue to target the UK."The increasing sophistication of crime groups, coupled with the changing nature of their geographical reach, demonstrates more than ever the requirement for an increasingly co-ordinated response," said NCA Director General Lynne Owens"Working alongside our law enforcement, intelligence and other partners, we are changing the way we operate to ensure the biggest possible impact. We will use this intelligence assessment to build on our operational successes and evidence why further investment in capabilities and capacity is necessary."
