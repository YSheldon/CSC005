The developers behind Git and various companies providing Git repository hosting services have pushed out a fix to patch a dangerous vulnerability in the Git source code versioning software.The fix is included with Of these, CVE-2018-11235 is considered the most dangerous, as it allows a malicious actor to create a malformed Git repository containing a specially-built Git submodule.Whenever a user clones this repository, because of the way Git clients handle this malicious Git submodule may allow an attacker to execute code on users' systems.Git 2.17.1, released last night, should prevent the execution of these commands on users' computers.But patches aren't only rolled out to Git clients. A fix is also included for Git's server-side component. This server-side fix allows Git hosting services to recognize code repositories containing malicious submodules, and block users from uploading them in the first place.Git hosting services like GitHub and Microsoft (via its Visual Studio Team Services) have already deployed the patches to prevent attackers from abusing their services."This is actually where most of the work went," said Jeff King, a GitHub staff member. "The fix itself was pretty trivial, but detection during [Git push operations] required a lot of refactoring."King said the work involved many projects. "I wrote the patches for Git itself, but others worked on libgit2, JGit, and VSTS," he added.Edward Thomson, Program Manager for Visual Studio Team Services, has also Credit for the discovery of this vulnerability goes to Etienne Stalmans, who reported it via GitHub's bug bounty program. Users are advised to update their Git desktop and/or server clients.
