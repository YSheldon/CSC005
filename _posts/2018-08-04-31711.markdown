At last month's Hackers on Planet Earth (The trouble was, the MAGA miscreants had mostly gamed and exploited the Mozilla staffer Jairus Khan The HOPE meltdown, and similar problems at the Chaos Computer Club conference last December, suggest that there is an organized attempt to disrupt hacking events by members of the alt-"When I designed the updated DEF CON Code of Conduct in 2015, I had a few goals in mind," "I wanted it to act as a template for other conferences, if they chose to do so. It was legally reviewed by our outside law firm and a specialist. In 2018, it's looking like it may get seriously crash tested."The upshot is: the DEF CON Code of Conduct is a broad guideline, rather than a set of laws that other conferences have tried to apply fairly to all sides, even if one side is being deliberately disruptive, and run into problems.Simply put: if you're an asshole, you'll get thrown out. Moss said he will "err on the side of removing people, rather than allow them to spoil the conference for those who just want to contribute in a positive way."Security at DEF CON is handled by a group of red-t-shirt-wearing volunteers known as the goons. They make sure no one gets out of line, break up potential trouble with tact and diplomacy, and aren't above physically ejecting troublemakers.One of the unwritten rules of DEF CON is that you never, ever, cross the goons. If anyone tries anything next week they are likely to be kicked into the fetid hell of the August Las Vegas sunshine with a boot mark on their backsides. Å½
