This is despite the fact that 56% admitted their organization has been involved in a breach of consumer data.Jarad Carleton, industry principal, cybersecurity at FrostSullivan, argued that the information age is at a crossroads as more firms are being publicly held to account for failing to protect customer data.What the survey found is that there is certainly a price to pay  whether youre a consumer or you run a business that handles consumer data  when it comes to maintaining data privacy, he added. Respect for consumer privacy must become an ethical pillar for any business that collects user data.The study was conducted in March and April, before the GDPR came into force across the EU, so it will be interesting to see if the report tells a different story next year.
