Misidentification by facial recognition technology can happen to anyone  even sitting members of Congress. Thats the attention-grabbing headline of a The ACLUs opposition to law enforcement use of facial recognition tech  specifically Amazons Rekognition software  is long-standing and Using Rekognition, the ACLU said it paid $12.33 (less than a large pizza, the blog post is careful to point out) to build a database of 25,000 publicly available arrest photos and run that database against public photos of every sitting member of the House and Senate.The results? The software, according to ACLU, incorrectly identified 28 sitting members of Congress as individuals who have been arrested.The misidentified congresspeople were men and women, Republicans and Democrats  a diverse bunch including the likes of Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J., and Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif.The results support the concern that facial recognition technologies like Rekognition are especially likely to misidentify people of color. Thirty nine percent of the 28 misidentified members of Congress were people of color, despite the fact that people of color make up only about People of color are already disproportionately harmed by police practices, and its easy to see how Rekognition could exacerbate that, the ACLU writes. The Congressional Black Caucus recently wrote Rekognition is Despite the criticism, Amazon Web Services vice president for worldwide public sector, Teresa Carlson, We provide them the tools, we dont provide the solution application that they build, she said at the Aspen Security Conference. And we often dont know everything theyre actually utilizing the tool for. But they need to have the most innovative and cutting-edge tools they can.Echoing previous Amazon statements, Carlson added that government users have a responsibility to use the technology in an ethical way. When the government signs up with us, they still have to have ethical use rights of our tool, she said. So if theyre breaking the law, theyre doing something, we would pull that for those reasons. And they sign up and they know the use rights of our tools as well.The ACLUs concern, meanwhile, is that as a society we havent fully reckoned with what ethical use of this technology looks like. Because of this, and the racial bias concerns, the group argues that the tech is not yet ready for primetime.Congress should press for a federal moratorium on the use of face surveillance until its harms, particularly to vulnerable communities, are fully considered, Neema Singh Guliani, ACLU legislative counsel, said in a statement. The public deserves a full debate about how and if face surveillance should be used.
