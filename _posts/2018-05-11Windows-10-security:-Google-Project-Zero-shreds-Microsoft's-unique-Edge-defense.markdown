微软在Windows 10的内置漏洞缓解中大力推动了它的进步，以鼓励企业采用，但谷歌的Project Zo不相信关键的防御能够抵抗先进的黑客。项目零研究员Ivan Fratric已经发布了一个目前的ACG漏洞缓解是专有的边缘，目的是为了防止先进的攻击者在内存中执行恶意代码，如果他们已经破坏了在浏览器中的内容处理。FrATRIC在二月的旁路破坏-和HELOPED微软改进——一个定制的微软开发，以确保Edge的及时（JIT）JavaScript编译器与ACG使能一起工作。该解决方案需要在微软的部分相当大的努力，并涉及将边缘的JIT引擎放在自己的沙箱过程中，与浏览器的内容处理分开。防御应该最终阻止先进攻击者逃脱边缘的沙盒。然而，FrARCIC发现，虽然ACG通常支持该任务，但它和另一个称为代码完整性保护的特性，被另一个Windows 10开发的缓解特性（称为控制流保护（CFG）”所降低。Frasic主张，ACG在阻止所有攻击时都是成功的，ACG、CIG和CFG都需要绕过旁路。但CFG的情况并非如此，根据Frutic的说法，Chrome的站点隔离功能比用ACG启用的边缘更难绕过。目前，他继续说：“ACG确实实现了防止可执行内存被分配和修改的目的。然而，由于CFG、ACG和CIG的相互依赖性以及微软Windows中CFG的缺点，ACG本身不足以阻止高级攻击者逃离浏览器的沙盒和安装其他攻击。“谷歌的Chrome开发者看到了站点隔离，这涉及到每个站点的运行。站点在其自身的沙箱过程中，然而，整体FrATRIC认为，微软对ACG进行边缘化的定制本质上是有缺陷的。虽然本文关注的是微软EDGE，但我们认为，任何其他实施流程外JIT的尝试都会遇到类似的问题，“Fratric ZDNet已经联系了微软的评论，并会在收到一封回复后发布回复。微软错过了谷歌的90天截止日期，所以Goog。Le发布了一个漏洞缓解旁路的详细信息。谷歌在一周内第二次展示了另一个未修补的Windows 10漏洞。一个谷歌开发的内核模糊器帮助定位了几十个Linux安全漏洞。当解开未使用的推测执行路径时，CPU可以泄露数据。
Microsoft has heavily promoted the advances it's made in Windows 10's built-in exploit mitigations to encourage enterprise adoption, but Google's Project Zero isn't convinced key defenses can stand up to advanced hackers. Project Zero researcher Ivan Fratric has released a Currently ACG exploit mitigation is exclusive to Edge and aims to prevent advanced attackers from executing malicious code in memory if they've already compromised a content process in the browser.Fratric in February The bypass undermined -- and helped Microsoft improve -- a customization Microsoft developed to ensure Edge's Just in Time (JIT) JavaScript compilers worked with ACG enabled. The solution required considerable effort on Microsoft's part and involved putting Edge's JIT engine in its own sandboxed process, separate from the browser's content processes. The defense should ultimately stop advanced attackers escaping Edge's sandbox. However,Fratric found that while ACG generally stands up to the task, it and another feature called Code Integrity Guard, are let down by a further Windows 10 exploit mitigation feature called Control Flow Guard (CFG). Fratric contends that for ACG to be successful at blocking all attacks, ACG, CIG and CFG all need to be impervious to bypasses. But that's not the case with CFG, and in some attack scenarios Chrome's site-isolation feature would be harder to bypass than Edge with ACG enabled, according to Fratric. "Currently, He continues later: "ACG does succeed to fulfill its purpose of preventing executable memory from being allocated and modified. However, due to mutual dependence of CFG, ACG and CIG and the shortcomings of CFG in Microsoft Windows, ACG alone can't be sufficient to stop advanced attackers from escaping a browser's sandbox and mounting other attacks." Google's Chrome developers see site-isolation, which involves running each site in its own sandboxed process, as the However, overall Fratric believes that Microsoft's customizations that enabled ACG for Edge are inherently flawed. "While the paper focuses on Microsoft Edge, we believe that any other attempt to implement out-of-process JIT would encounter similar problems," Fratric ZDNet has contacted Microsoft for its comments and will post its response should one be received.Microsoft misses Google's 90-day deadline, so Google has published details of an exploit mitigation bypass.For the second time in a week, Google reveals another unpatched Windows 10 vulnerability.A Google-developed kernel fuzzer has helped locate dozens of Linux security flaws.CPUs can leak data when unwinding unused speculative execution paths.
