(Image: file photo)Venmo, the mobile payments app, won't say why it exposes users' data to the world whenever they make a transaction.In case you missed it, Hang Do Thi Duc, a Berlin-based privacy researcher found that every time someone sent or received money using In other words, everyone can see your transactions -- even without the app. Whether it's that $22 you sent one friend for splitting the cab ride home, or $300 from your parents because your health insurance is crap and you can't afford a doctor's appointment, it's all there."I used Venmo's public API to pull in all public transactions of 2017 -- a total of 207,984,218 transactions," he said in an email. "By looking through them, I learned a scary amount about Venmo users. I was able to follow a drug dealer's sales, watch a couple fight viciously on Valentine's Day, and learn exactly how many mangos a Santa Barbara, CA food cart sells each week.""I visualize all this data to make it clear just how public our Venmo transactions are -- and what they say about us," said Do Thi Duc. But We asked Venmo on Thursday why transactions are public by default, and if Venmo will change this policy in the near future, following up from other reporters Unsurprisingly, Venmo also did not respond by our deadline Friday.

And as Jake Beckman Beckman called that "some serious bulls**t." Venmo updated its apps Thursday, including We'll update if Venmo responds to our questions.You can send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755Â–8849.
