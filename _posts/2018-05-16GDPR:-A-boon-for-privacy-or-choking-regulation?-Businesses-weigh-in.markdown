欧盟GDPR的最后期限正在迅速临近，导致一些公司肆无忌惮的混乱。新法规迫使企业和中小企业重新考虑数据收集的观点，而新的要求可能有助于保护消费者的隐私和安全，企业则是SC。漫步于欧盟2018年5月25日的最后期限。星期三，IBM发布了一项新的研究结果，该报告是关于企业如何看待由通用数据保护条例（GDPR）引起的即将发生的变化。在截止日期之前，大多数公司现在正着手处理他们收集和管理的数据，因此，它们开始变得更有选择性。大多数调查者表示，他们的组织也开始处理数据以遵守新的规则。根据报告的数据，大约80%的组织声称他们正在削减他们收集和存储的个人信息的数量，70%的AR。E处理数据，78%的人减少了访问存储信息的人数。减少数据收集、存储和共享将有助于公司管理GDPR——但也会对消费者产生连锁效应。在一个充满数据泄露和网络攻击的世界里，通过我们使用的许多在线服务，每个人都存储着更多的信息，信息泄露的风险也越来越大，无论是通过公司本身、第三方还是那些有权获得这些信息的人。总的来说，76%的受访者认为GDPR应该改善信任和企业和消费者之间的关系，84%的人认为GDPR遵从将使他们的公司成为公众的一个利器，然而，在电子商务中仍然存在着一个巨大的鸿沟。UrPePeAn联盟的数据保护梦想和公司行动，因为只有36%的组织相信他们会及时准备好。公司必须准确地知道消费者收集了什么信息，存储了哪些信息，以及是否准确和必要。组织还必须遵守欧盟的数据处理和共享原则，并且必须确保消费者同意。为了保持他们的信息记录。（如果你最近收到了一些公司要求保持联系的电子邮件，那么在GDPR截止日期之前就有必要获得同意。）企业也必须确保他们的跨境数据处理符合GDPR法令。另一个主要问题是CO。在欧盟运营的企业必须在72小时内向监管机构报告数据违规。根据IBM的研究，只有31%的组织已经准备好了这个要求。尽管目前的混乱，22%的公司正在利用GDPR来改善他们的运营商。在这个子集中，有93%个修改了他们的事件响应设置，79%个正在准备数据准确性检查，74%个正在为产品和服务实施新的安全和隐私系统。“GDPR将是影响商业模式的最大破坏性力量之一。IBM安全部门的数据安全隐私部CTO Cindy Compert说：“工业及其延伸范围远远超出了欧盟边界。”GDPR的出现也是在消费者对企业保护个人数据能力的巨大不信任中产生的。“这些因素共同创造了一个完美的风暴，让公司重新思考他们的数据责任的方法，并开始恢复今天所需要的信任。数据驱动的经济，“行政长官补充说。
tThe deadline for the EU's GDPR is fast approaching, causing unbridled chaos for some companies.The new regulations are forcing the enterprise and SMBs alike to rethink their perspective on data collection, and while new requirements may help protect consumer privacy and security, businesses are scrambling to meet the European Union's 25 May 2018 deadline.On Wednesday, IBM released the results of a new study into how businesses view the impending changes caused by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Ahead of the deadline, the majority of companies are now tackling exactly what data they collect and manage -- and as a result, have begun to become more selective. The majority of survey respondents said their organizations have also begun disposing of data in order to comply with the new rules.Based on the report's data, roughly 80 percent of organizations claim they are cutting down on the amount of personal information they collect and store, 70 percent are disposing of data, and 78 percent are reducing the number of people who have access to stored information.Cutting down data collection, storage, and sharing will help companies manage GDPR -- but will also have a knock-on effect for consumers, too. In a world full of data breaches and cyberattacks, the more information is stored about individuals through each of the many online services we use, the more risk there is for information to become compromised, whether through the company itself, a third-party, or someone who has access to these records.In total, 76 percent of respondents said that GDPR should improve trust and the relationship between businesses and consumers, with 84 percent believing that GDPR compliance will put their firms in good stead as a differentiator to the public.However, there is still a wide chasm between the European Union's data protection dreams and company action as only 36 percent of organizations believe they will be ready in time.There are challenges associated with GDPR which companies are facing as we speak. Companies have to know exactly what information from consumers has been collected, where it is stored, and whether or not it is accurate and necessary.Organizations must also now comply with the EU's data processing and sharing principles and they must ensure that consent has been given by consumers to keep their information on record.(If you have recently been receiving emails from companies asking to stay in touch, the need for consent ahead of the GDPR deadline is why.)Businesses must also ensure their cross-border data handling complies with the GDPR decree.Another major issue is that companies operating in the EU must report data breaches to regulators within 72 hours. According to IBM's research, only 31 percent of organizations have prepared for this requirement.Despite the current chaos, 22 percent of companies are taking advantage of GDPR to improve their business operators. Of this subset, 93 percent have modified their incident response setups, 79 percent are preparing for data accuracy checks, and 74 percent were implementing new security and privacy systems for products and services."GDPR will be one of the biggest disruptive forces impacting business models across industries -- and its reach extends far beyond the EU borders," said Cindy Compert, CTO, Data SecurityPrivacy at IBM Security. "The onset of GDPR also comes during a time of huge distrust among consumers toward businesses ability to protect their personal data.""These factors together have created a perfect storm for companies to rethink their approach to data responsibility and begin to restore the trust needed in today's data-driven economy," the executive added.
