Cisco has resolved a set of critical vulnerabilities in Policy Suite which permit attackers to cause havoc in the software's databases.This week, the tech giant released a security advisory detailing four vulnerabilities which could place enterprise users at risk of information leaks, account compromise, database tampering, and more.The first vulnerability, The bug has been caused by a simple lack of authentication and as there is no requirement for identity verification, Policy Builder databases can be accessed and tampering with without limitation. Cisco Policy Suite releases prior to 18.2.0 are affected.The second vulnerability, The serious security problem has emerged due to the use of undocumented, static user credentials for root accounts.
