This means out-of-date and insecure platforms like Windows XP are not uncommon, warned Malik.“Whether we’re talking about a power station, a hospital or your Alexa at home we need to be able to identify all vulnerable devices, ensure they’re properly segmented and know what activity is going on,” concluded Malik.He added that organizations need to upgrade where possible to ensure devices are as secure as they can be, and to support modern, secure IoT architectures, as well as plan for regulatory mandates.Europe’s new
