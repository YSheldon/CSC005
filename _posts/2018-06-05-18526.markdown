ÂI need us all as an information security community to get our hands dirty now.ÂThose organizations that need to secure data over an entire customers lifetime could have a problem if they donÂt prepare for the possibility that the crypto they use to secure it now may be effectively obsolete in a couple of decades, Baloo claimed.WhatÂs more, governments around the world including the US National Security Agency (NSA) are hoovering up encrypted communications with a Âcapture now, decrypt laterÂ strategy which could see old state and trade secrets fall into the wrong hands in time.As it currently stands, security pros could extend the lifetime of AES-256 encryption through the quantum computing era by increasing the key size, while SHA-256 and SHA-3 could still work securely with a larger output, claimed Baloo.However, RSA, DSA, ECDSA and ECDH standards would no longer be effective, she warned.Quantum computing could offer advances in everything from earlier detection of cancer to MRI scanning and even metrology.
