自从他们发现了第一波之后。Jann Horn，这不仅仅是一个英特尔问题。它也影响x86（英特尔和AMD芯片组）、电源8、电源9、系统Z和少数ARM处理器。简而言之，它可以允许几乎任何一个二十一世纪处理器上的未经授权的读取访问内存。英特尔称这是另一个新但不那么危险的幽灵风格安全漏洞，本地用户可以通过侧通道分析获得系统参数的未授权泄露。外部攻击，通过网络浏览器处理恶意的有效载荷，这两种攻击都不太可能。根据英特尔的问题。这是因为，英特尔称，“大多数领先的浏览器提供商最近在他们的托管运行时部署了缓解措施，这大大增加了在现代Web浏览器中开发侧通道的难度。这些技术同样会增加在基于SSB的浏览器中开发侧通道的难度。“为了解决这个问题，英特尔已经向操作系统供应商、设备制造商和其他生态系统合作伙伴发布了beta微代码更新，增加了对投机商店BYPAS的支持。S禁用（SSBD）。SSBD提供了额外的保护，通过阻止投机商店旁路发生。英特尔最希望的主要操作系统和管理程序将增加支持投机商店旁路禁用（SSBD）开始早在2018年5月21日。这一更新还解决了流氓系统寄存器读取（RSRR）。它通过确保RDMSR指令不会在某些条件下推测性地返回数据，不需要任何操作系统或管理程序更改来支持这个补丁。其他操作系统供应商将很快发布补丁。它有多糟糕？红帽也同样重要。这似乎对我来说是正确的。它将需要当地用户和一些努力来利用这个漏洞，但它是完全可行的。值得注意的是，一个“本地”用户不必有人登录到服务器。例如，谁是容器上的“本地”用户？Red Hat状态，“每个Linux容器包括一个Linux基础层。对于在生产环境中使用的这些容器，重要的是该内容不存在已知的漏洞。如果容器包括内核、虚拟化组件或下面列出的其他组件，则应该更新它们。一旦被更新，就不需要容器特定的相关操作，除非容器依赖或包含受影响的包。下面的文件必须更新：内核、内核RT、LIVILT、QEMU KVM RHEV、OpenJDK、MICROCODEL CLT和LIUXX固件。“正如Chris Robinson，红帽的产品安全保证经理所说，”这个漏洞（CVE-20183639）是最近关注的缺陷的最新例子。现代计算的基本要素，跨多个硬件和软件平台的漏洞。虽然缺陷需要一个复杂的攻击者利用，客户应该迅速采取行动，以硬件和软件更新，以减少开发的风险。“鲁滨孙的权利。当修补程序可用时，部署它们。
After the first-wave of Since the They've been found. Jann Horn, a This is far more than an Intel problem. It also affects x86 (Intel and AMD chipsets), POWER 8, POWER 9, System z, and a few ARM processors. In short, it could allow unauthorized read access to memory on almost any 21st century processor. The Intel calls this a Another new but less dangerous Spectre-style security hole is With this, local users may be able to get unauthorized disclosure of system parameters via a side-channel analysis.External attacks, via a web browser processing a malicious payload, are less likely with both these problems according to Intel. That's because, Intel states, "Most leading browser providers have recently deployed mitigations in their Managed Runtimes -- mitigations that substantially increase the difficulty of exploiting side channels in a modern web browser. These techniques would likewise increase the difficulty of exploiting a side channel in a browser based on SSB."To fix the problem, Intel has released beta microcode updates to operating system vendors, equipment manufacturers, and other ecosystem partners adding support for Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD). SSBD provides additional protection by blocking Speculative Store Bypass from occurring.Intel hopesmost major operating system and hypervisors will add support for Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) starting as early as May 21, 2018.This update also addresses Rogue System Register Read (RSRR). It does this by ensuring that RDMSR instructions will not speculatively return data under certain conditions.No operating system or hypervisor changes are required to support this patch.Other operating system vendors will be issuing patches shortly.How bad is it? Red Hat rates it as Important. That seems about right to me. It would take a local user and some effort to exploit this hole, but it's perfectly doable. It's worth keeping in mind that a "local" user doesn't have to be someone logged into a server. For example, who's the "local" user on a container? Red Hat states, "Every Linux container includes a Linux base layer. For these containers to be used in production environments, it is important that this content is free from known vulnerabilities. If the container includes a kernel, virtualization components, or other components listed below, they should be updated. Once updated, there are no container-specific related actions that need to be taken unless the container has dependencies upon or includes the affected packages. The following files must be updated: kernel, kernel-rt,libvirt, qemu-kvm-rhev, openjdk, microcode_clt, and linux_firmware."As Chris Robinson, Red Hat's Manager of Product Security Assurance, said, "This vulnerability (CVE-2018-3639) is the latest example of flaws discovered by a recent focus on the fundamental elements of modern computing, vulnerabilities that cross numerous hardware and software platforms. While the flaws require a sophisticated attacker to exploit, customers should act quickly to apply both hardware and software updates to reduce the risk of exploitation."Robinson's right. When the patches are available, deploy them.
