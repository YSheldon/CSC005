谷歌在几周前生效的欧盟通用数据保护条例（GDPR）之前更新了其隐私政策。俗话说，一张图片值一千字，谷歌正在采用这种新的隐私政策，将在5月25日推出，GDPR在欧洲生效，对数据收集、使用和同意提出更严格的规则。内容的布局在很大程度上没有改变，但不是使用具有描述和弹头的文本重载章节，新的策略引导了可以单击的内容类别列表，以跳转到策略的每个部分。或者简短的YouTube视频，用简单的语言解释它的策略意味着什么以及它所覆盖的设备和服务，包括Android、Chrome、搜索、地图、YouTube和谷歌首页。重新设计的目的是让用户更容易找到谷歌公司的信息。TS并理解它为什么会这么做。它还提供了导致隐私设置的策略内的链接。我们改进了导航和组织策略，使您更容易找到您正在寻找的东西；更详细地解释了我们的实践和更清晰的语言；并且添加了更多关于您必须管理、导出和删除我们服务的数据的选项，“William Malcolm，谷歌EMEA隐私法律总监，谷歌也将发电子邮件给所有用户，告知他们新政策，这意味着数十亿人会收到通知。谷歌的GDPR顺应性努力的另一个重点是数据可移植性。为了支持这个问题，谷歌最近发布了“数据传输项目设想了一个适配器的生态系统，它将一系列专有格式转换成少量用于传输数据的标准格式，”谷歌允许使用任何两个服务提供商之间的数据传输。服务提供商现有的授权机制，并允许每个服务提供商保持对其服务的安全性的控制。“为了鼓励服务提供商采用该技术，项目将用户数据和服务提供商的数据区分开来。”可移植性不应扩展到收集到的数据以使服务运行，包括为提高系统性能或可能具有商业敏感性或专有性的培训模型而生成的数据。“最后，谷歌将其家庭链接Android应用程序推广到欧盟内部所有国家。直到现在，家庭链接服务的应用程序让父母为他们的孩子的Android设备创建一个谷歌账户，并管理他们的孩子可以使用的应用程序。“根据新的规则，公司必须得到父母的同意，以在一定的情况下处理他们孩子的数据。”马尔科姆说。本周在谷歌I/O上概述了AI驱动未来的愿景，数据隐私讨论刚刚开始。别忘了分享数据的投资回报。与其他公司不同的是，谷歌在剑桥分析灾难之后没有戳脸谱网。谷歌希望其客户知道它强调的是保护组织敏感数据和资产的产品。在欧盟新的数据法之前，巨人正在更新隐私政策。脸谱网正在做出改变，以防止以前欧洲法律中的非欧洲用户受到一般数据保护法规的保护。报告显示大多数组织没有准备好新的数据。检测规则。
Google has updated the presentation of its privacy policy ahead of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that comes into force in a few weeks. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, and Google is adopting this approach to its new privacy policy that will roll out on May 25, the day GDPR takes effect in Europe, introducing stricter rules on data collection, usage and consent. The layout of the The contents are largely unchanged, but rather than using text-heavy chapters with descriptions and bullet points, the new policy leads with a list of content categories that can be clicked to hop to each section of the policy.Each section of the policy now includes illustrations or short YouTube videos that explain in simple language what the policy means and what devices and services it covers, including Android, Chrome, Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Home.The purpose of the redesign is to make it easier for users to find information about what information Google collects and understand why it does it. It also offers links within the policy that lead to privacy settings. "We've improved the navigation and organization of the policy to make it easier to find what you're looking for; explained our practices in more detail and with clearer language; and added more detail about the options you have to manage, export, and delete data from our services," William Malcolm, director of privacy legal at Google EMEA, Google will also be emailing all its users to inform them about the new policy, meaning billions of people are set to receive the notification. Another part of Google's GDPR compliance effort focuses on data portability. To support this issue, Google recently released the "Data Transfer Project envisions an ecosystem of adapters that convert a range of proprietary formats into a small number of canonical formats useful for transferring data," Google "This allows data transfer between any two service providers using the service provider's existing authorization mechanism, and allows each service provider to maintain control over the security of their service."To encourage service providers to adopt the technology, the project draws a distinction between a user's data and a service provider's data. "Portability should not extend to data collected to make a service operate, including data generated to improve system performance or train models that may be commercially sensitive or proprietary."Finally, Google is rolling out its Family Link Android app to all countries within the EU. Until now the Family Link service The app lets parents create a Google Account for their child's Android device and manage what apps their children can use."Under the new rules, companies must get consent from parents to process their children's data in certain circumstances," notes Malcolm.Google outlined its vision of an AI driven future this week at Google I/O and the data privacy discussion is just starting. Don't forget the return on investment for you sharing data.Unlike others, Google didn't jab Facebook in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica disaster.Google wants its customers to know that it's emphasizing products that protect an organization's sensitive data and assets.Here's how the social media giant is updating privacy policies ahead of the EU's new data law.Facebook is making changes that will prevent non-European users previously under European laws from being protected by the General Data Protection Regulation.Report shows a majority of organizations aren't ready for the new data protection rules.
