A payment data Ticketmaster UK said that it was breached via Inbenta, a third-party customer service chat application it used on its website. According to RiskIQ, the breach was the work of Magecart, a threat group that seeks out insecure code on e-commerce website. The group thenÂ modifies or replaces the code in order to steal customersÂ payment information.TicketmasterÂs and InbentaÂs initial accounts of the breach differed slightly.Â  The ticketing giantÂ However, RiskIQ says it observed instances where the Inbenta code provided to Ticketmaster, which was hosted on Inbenta servers, Âhad been wholly replaced with Magecart skimmers.Â RiskIQ says this suggests that Inbenta was breached.ÂTo modify the source of this module, the attackers would have needed access to InbentaÂs systems in some way or form,Â the report says.Another possibility that RiskIQ suggests is that an administrative account with access to the Inbenta module was breached.ÂUnless the companies provide more transparency into the event, we will never know,Â RiskIQ writes.Reached for comment, an Inbenta spokesperson did not provide any more information about how InbentaÂs code was compromised, pointed CyberScoop to a When Ticketmaster disclosed the breach, it said InbentaÂs tool was running on several websites that the ticketing service runs: International, UK, GETMEIN! and TicketWeb. But RiskIQ says spotted the Magecart skimmer on other Ticketmaster websites: Ticketmaster Ireland, Ticketmaster Turkey, Ticketmaster New Zealand and Ticketmaster Australia.Beyond that, RiskIQ says TicketmasterÂs Germany, Australia and International websites were compromised by way of a totally separate third-party vendor, SociaPlus (now known as Insider), a digital marketing platform.ÂTicketmaster uses a lot of third parties to supply functionality on their websites which are still a risk for them as weÂve seen with Inbenta,Â Yonathan Klijnsma, a researcher at RiskIQ, told CyberScoop by email. ÂMagecart is the supply chain attack for the web.ÂRiskIQ says that MagecartÂs campaign extends well beyond Ticketmaster and Inbenta, claiming it identified 800 websites that have fallen victim to its skimmer. TheyÂve been able to do that, RiskIQ explains, by targeting third-party applications (like Inbenta) rather than individual websites.The researchers say they are able to link the campaign to all these victims because of a common command and control server used by Magecart.Klijnsma said RiskIQ did not coordinate the release of its report with Ticketmaster or any other victim it identified, but that it plans to release a broader report on Magecart after completing a coordinated effort.Ticketmaster did not respond to a request for comment.
