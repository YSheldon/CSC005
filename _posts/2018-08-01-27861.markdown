Reddit, one of the worlds most popular websites and the self-proclaimed front page of the internet, was hacked in June, exposing some user data, internal logs, source code and other files, according to a post published to the platform Wednesday.Chief Technology Officer Christopher Slowe Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, read the post from Slowe, who goes by the username u/KeyserSosa. We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA.With SMS codes and passwords in hand, the hackers were able to get access to two important areas of user data contained in backup files.

The digests connected Reddit usernames to emails, and showed suggested content from specific forums within the site  also known as subreddits  that the users subscribed to.The attacker also gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code, and other logs. They were unable to alter any information on the site itself, which is a vast collection of forums that allows users to upload content based on their interests and rate what is uploaded using a voting system. Currently, it is the fifth-most popular website in the United States, and 17th most popular globally.Since the attack, Reddit says it has been cooperating with law enforcement officials and their investigation, has notified users who may have been affected and heightened security through enhanced logging, more encryption and requiring token-based two factor authentication. Token-based 2FA typically means requiring users to have a piece of hardware, like a physical security Reddit is the latest organization to fall victim to a SMS-intercept based attack, but the vulnerability is nothing new. In 2014, cybersecurity experts began warning the public that And in December 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology urged government agencies to
