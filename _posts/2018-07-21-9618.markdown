A security feature that's included with the Microsoft Edge browser appears to have stopped working, according to Gareth Heyes, a security researcher with cyber-security firm PortSwigger.The security feature in question is named "XSS Filter" and is a Microsoft-developed security mechanism that can prevent basic cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks inside browsers.Microsoft developed and launched XSS Filter This security feature is also known as "X-XSS-Protection." It is known by this name because website owners can configure an HTTP header named "X-XSS-Protection" for the server that delivers their sites.When browsers load a page from these sites and detect this header, they will run the XSS Filter protections based on the value of that header, which can be one of three values:When a browser sees a header of "When a browser sees a header of "When a browser sees "For the past three years, since Edge has been released, Edge has used the second value as a default setting, meaning Edge would try to sanitize the code of any page it loads, regardless if it had an X-XSS-Protection header configured or not.But this week, Heyes "The XSS Filter is supposed to be on by default," Heyes said. "However, it is now off by default, and even if you try to turn it on with The reasons why XSS Filter is off by default for all sites is unknown, as there was not any official announcement from Microsoft or the Edge team.But this doesn't appear to be an intentional reconfiguration from Microsoft's part. Instead, this appears to be a bug.This is because the feature works as intended in Internet Explorer, Microsoft's other browser, where it is still on by default. If Microsoft had wanted to remove this feature, it would have done so from both of its browsers.Furthermore, XSS Filter can still be enabled in Edge, but when websites specifically use its third highest security level setting  which most website owners avoid using since it blocks Edge from displaying sites altogether."The only way to actually turn it on now is when you have the header A Microsoft spokesperson has not been on hand to respond to a request for comment from Bleeping Computer. Microsoft said "We have nothing to share" to PortSwigger when the company reached out for comment earlier this week.But PortSwigger researchers have also built a case that removing XSS Filter might also be a good idea, if Microsoft has truly gone that way, and why many security researchers won't be crying too much about it.For starters, many researchers have bypassed this feature or abused it to carry out other attacks on the underlying browser [Second, Mozilla has Third, according to the MDN portal, Fourth, the feature is often So, even if it's a bug or that Microsoft has disabled it on purpose, it appears that the feature doesn't have that many fans, to begin with.
