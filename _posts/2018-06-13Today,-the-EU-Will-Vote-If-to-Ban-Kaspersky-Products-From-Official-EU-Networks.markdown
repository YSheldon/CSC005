在今天将在法国斯特拉斯堡举行的欧洲议会全体会议上，欧洲议会成员（MEPS）将这一特别禁止条款列入A8—0189／2018（该议案的目的是为欧盟范围内的网络防御战略制定总体准则）。在该议案冗长的机构中，也有一条涉及公私合作的条款。根据第76条，如果动议通过外交事务委员会提出的提案，欧盟国家将被要求并预期审查和禁止已确认为错误的软件程序。这一动议的案文是指卡巴斯基产品在去年被美国设定的“确认为恶意”之后，“措辞（确认））很有趣，但为了充分理解它，你需要知道这份报告起源于外交事务委员会。但是，在“网络活动”的语境中，措辞在技术语境中也有着特定的意义。所以你可能会有深刻的印象。但更可能的是，这可能是对公众新闻报道反应的简单，“Olejnik博士补充说。”今天的欧盟议会投票是在其他三个国家对卡巴斯基实验室采取措施之后。R，“Olejnik博士说，”这一连串的行动可能是对已经知道的数据的一种级联措施，但这也可能是公众舆论持续压力的结果。“所有的级联禁令都是在美国当局指责莫斯科的反病毒疫苗之后产生的。与俄罗斯情报机构合作的多尔。Kaspersky Lab在过去一年里强烈否认了所有指控。俄罗斯公司甚至上个月，卡巴斯基宣布了有关此事的第一个细节，但尽管Kaspersky一直否认俄罗斯政府的间谍行为，但该公司最近的声誉急剧下降，但很明显，欧盟的禁令，如果得到批准，只适用于美国。在EU机构中，“危险项目”并不针对欧盟商业软件市场。在欧盟，这一禁令的最大反响将是卡巴斯基与欧洲刑警组织的关系，这在过去导致了无数网络犯罪分子的被捕和创造。F不清楚这种合作是否会继续下去，即使禁令是指使用软件程序。欧洲刑警组织和卡巴斯基实验室发言人未能就拟议中的禁令和两个组织之间的伙伴关系的未来发表评论。欧元区专家预计对今天的A8—0189／2018动议进行积极投票，主要是因为这份文件载有北约的重要合作伙伴克劳斯。ES，网络防御战略，以及其他更重要的主张。A8 0189／2018动议是昨天6月12日公开辩论的主题。为什么要禁止公司每天保护来自欧洲的3K恶意威胁？本周，在另一家即将面临禁令的公司投票表决的倒退步骤，即使不是直接在议案中被命名为中兴，因为同样的条款也引用了“设备”而非仅仅是软件程序。中兴被指控多年
In a plenary session of the European Parliament that will be held today in Strasbourg, France, members of the European Parliament (MEPs) This particular ban clause is included in A8-0189/2018 [The motion's purpose is to establish general guidelines for an EU-wide strategy on cyber defense. In the motion's lengthy body, there is also a clause that addresses public-private partnerships.According to clause #76, if the motion passes as proposed by the Foreign Affairs Commission, EU states will be called upon and expected to review and ban software programs that have been confirmed as malicious.The motion's text matter-of-factly refers to Kaspersky products as "confirmed as malicious," following the lead set by the US last year."The wording ('confirmed') is interesting, but to fully appreciate it you need to be aware this report has its origins in the Foreign Affairs Committee where words like that matter," "However, in context of 'cyber-activity', the wording also has a specific meaning in technology context. So you may have an impression of a deep insight. But more likely, it may be as simple as a reactive response to public press reports," Dr. Olejnik added.Today's EU Parliament vote comes after three other countries have taken steps against Kaspersky Lab. Previously, "Policy-making process is lengthy, and at European Parliament, it takes even longer," Dr. Olejnik said."The continued string of action might be a cascading measure in response to the already known data, but it may as well be a consequence to the continuous pressure by the public opinion."All the cascading bans come after US authorities have accused the Moscow-based antivirus vendor of collaborating with Russian intelligence agencies.Kaspersky Lab has vehemently denied all accusations for the past year. The Russian company even Last month, Kaspersky announced the first details about this But despite Kaspersky's constant denial of spying on behalf of the Russian government, the company's reputation took a nosedive recently, as But to be clear, the proposed EU ban, if approved, applies only to the use of "dangerous programs" inside EU institutions and does not target the EU commercial software market.In the EU, the biggest repercussion of this proposed ban will be Kaspersky's relationship with Europol, which in the past has resulted in the arrest of countless cybercriminals and the creation of the It is unclear if this partnership will be allowed to continue, even if the ban refers to use of software programs. Europol and Kaspersky Lab spokespersons were not available for comment on the proposed ban and the future of the partnership between the two organizations.Eurozone experts expect a positive vote on today's A8-0189/2018 motion, mainly because the document is laden with crucial NATO cooperation clauses, cyber defense strategies, and other more important propositions.The A8-0189/2018 motion was the subject of a public plenary debate yesterday, June 12. The Why ban the company protecting Europeans from 320K malicious threats a day? A backwards step voted on this week in Another company that faces an impending ban, even if not named in the motion directly, is ZTE, since the same clause also references "devices" and not software programs alone. ZTE has been accused for years of
