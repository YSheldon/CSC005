腾讯公司敏锐的安全实验室揭示了宝马汽车在车载计算系统中的一些漏洞。在2017年1月至2018年2月间，腾讯敏锐的安全实验室研究人员对各种宝马模型进行了测试，重点是头单元和T-box组件。经过13个月的研究，研究小组发现了14个漏洞，可能会使连接的汽车面临妥协的风险。这些测试是在宝马的支持和实验室条件下进行的。受影响的车辆包括在汽车制造商的I系列、X1 S驱动器、5系列和7系列中。总的来说，如在漏洞中所记载的，允许攻击者访问头部单元——否则称为信息娱乐系统——以及包括远程信息处理控制单元和CE的T-box组件。在测试中涉及的车辆的NATRAL网关模块，导致创建和部署用于控制CAN总线的开发链。考虑到这些总线连接所有汽车的功能，CAN总线的攻击暴露是一个严重的问题。一旦CAN总线处于攻击者控制之下，研究人员就可以远程触发任意的诊断功能。锐利的安全实验室也会遇到内存损坏漏洞、逻辑错误、可能破坏安全隔离系统区域的漏洞以及可能导致的漏洞。该团队还能够通过利用USB、以太网和OBD-II连接来物理地破坏汽车。“随着网络驱动程序，USB以太网网络将被启用，当USB Gile插入特定的芯片组时，”报告称。[NBT头单元将充当具有固定IP地址（192.1680.1）的网络网关。更糟糕的是，对这种USB以太网接口没有任何安全限制，这使得有可能获得对头部单元的内部网络的访问，然后通过端口扫描检测到许多暴露的内部服务。一个精心制作的恶意更新文件能够破坏HU英特尔的更新服务和增益根控制，这是一个控制多媒体服务和宝马连接驱动功能的系统。一旦敏锐的安全实验室的发现得到验证，就制定出一些最关键的问题的措施。锿。这些升级已经推出后端系统，并通过空中（OTA）更新上传到远程信息处理控制单元。将在经销商处获得额外的软件更新。目前的研究忽略了最重要的技术要素，以防止网络化。在宝马解决了所有的安全漏洞之前，攻击者滥用了安全漏洞。然而，双方都计划在2019发布一个更大的安全漏洞、开发链和他们已经解决的方法。在技术进步和新的、未知的攻击场景下，宝马集团推出了一项全面的网络安全行动计划，其中包括宝马集团内部和独立机构的帮助下进行的测试。第三方在提高汽车安全性方面起着至关重要的作用，因为他们对产品和服务进行了深入的测试。“由于成功的主动性，腾讯敏锐的安全实验室和宝马目前正在讨论新的网络安全研究合作的选择。未来的研究建议将集中于谷歌Android嵌入式车载系统，以及自主驾驶、测试和OTA更新机制的安全性。
tTencent's Keen Security Lab has revealed a number of vulnerabilities in the onboard compute systems of select BMW vehicles.Between January 2017 and February 2018, Tencent Keen Security Lab researchers conducted tests with various BMW models, with a focus on the head unit and T-Box components. After 13 months of research, the team discovered 14 vulnerabilities which could place connected cars at risk of compromise.The tests were conducted with BMW's backing and in laboratory conditions. Impacted vehicles are included in the automaker's i Series, X1 sDrive, 5 Series, and 7 Series.In total, as documented in The vulnerabilities permitted attackers to access the head unit -- otherwise known as the infotainment system -- and T-box components including the Telematics Control Unit and Central Gateway Module of the vehicles involved in the tests, leading to the creation and deployment of exploit chains designed to seize control of CAN buses.The exposure of CAN buses to attack is a serious issue considering that these buses connect all of a car's functions. Once the CAN buses were under attacker control, the researchers were able to trigger arbitrary diagnostic functions remotely.Keen Security Lab also came across memory corruption vulnerabilities, logic errors, bugs which could break secure isolation system areas, and vulnerabilities which could lead to remote code execution.The team was also able to compromise the car physically through exploiting USB, Ethernet, and OBD-II connections."With network drivers, the USB-Ethernet network will be enabled when a USB dongle with some specific chipsets plugged in," the report states. "[The] NBT head unit will act as a network gateway with a fixed IP address (192.168.0.1). What's worse, there aren't any security restrictions to such USB Ethernet Interface, which makes it possible to obtain access to the internal network of the head unit, and then detect many exposed internal services through port scanning."Furthermore, it was possible to use a USB stick to implement a crafted, malicious update file able to compromise the update service and gain root control of hu-Intel, a system which controls multimedia services and BMW ConnectedDrive functionality.Once Keen Security Lab's findings were verified, measures were developed to patch some of the most critical issues. These upgrades have been rolled out to backend systems and uploaded to telematics control units via over-the-air (OTA) updates.Additional software updates will be made available at dealerships.The current research does omit the most crucial technical elements of exploits in order to prevent cyberattackers abusing weaknesses in BMW security before the company resolves all of the vulnerabilities mentioned.However, both parties plan to publish a more substantial account of the security flaws, exploit chains, and the ways they have been resolved in 2019."In response to what has become a race between technological progress and new, presently unknown attack scenarios, the BMW Group has launched a comprehensive cybersecurity action plan, which includes tests conducted both internally by the BMW Group and with the help of independent institutions," the company said. "Third parties increasingly play a crucial role in improving automotive security as they conduct their own in-depth tests of products and services."Due to the success of the initiative, Tencent Keen Security Lab and BMW are currently discussing options for new cybersecurity research collaboration. Future research proposals will focus on Google Android embedded vehicle systems, as well as autonomous driving, testing, and the security of OTA update mechanisms.
