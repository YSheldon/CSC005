AhnLab, a South Korea-based cyber-security firm, has released today a vaccine app that blocks the GandCrab ransomware from taking root and encrypting users' files.This vaccine app works by creating a special file on users' computers that the GandCrab ransomware checks before encrypting user data.This file is named [hexadecimal-string].lock and is saved at the following locations.The hexadecimal ID is generated based on the computer's volume information of the root drive and a custom Salsa20 algorithm and is unique per user.GandCrab creates this file to know if a computer has already been infected and prevent users from running the ransomware executable twice and double-encrypting and permanently destroying their data.The AhnLab vaccine app can create this file in advance, before a user might get infected, hence tricking the ransomware into thinking it has already locked the victim's data.Unfortunately, this vaccine app works only with the latest version of the GandCrab ransomware, version 4.1.2, the version that's currently distributed in the wild since this week, July 17.The addition of this .lock file mechanism appears to have been added with the release of GandCrab v4, at the start of July, as detailed in While the current vaccine app blocks GandCrab v4.1.2, it may also be possible to backport the app and prevent older GandCrab v4 versions from infecting users as well.This is because older GandCrab versions used even a simpler method of creating the .lock file.
