T比特币黄金（BTG）似乎是51%攻击的目标，导致窃听交易的大约1750万美元的窃取。硬币的交易者，仔细检查网络上的异常活动，揭示了该计划，其中“双重开支”攻击已经启动了AGA。第一次攻击记录在5月16日，现在看来已经停止了。“一个拥有大量HAXPOWER的未知政党试图用“51%次攻击”来进行“双花钱”攻击来窃取货币F。“ROM交流，”团队说。我们一直建议所有交易所增加确认，仔细审查大型存款。对典型用户或持有的现有基金没有风险。“51%次攻击迫使B股链重组。虽然不是安全漏洞或漏洞的结果，但攻击可以从理论上说是针对任何块链发起的。如果威胁者设法控制网络计算能力的50%以上，那么他们就能够修改和排除自己的硬币交易。然后，攻击者就可以重复使用，在确认后交易被逆转，同时阻止网络上的所有其他矿工挖掘有效的块。启动这些类型的攻击可能是昂贵的，并且由于需要巨大的计算能力，这是他们唯一的方法。盈利是尝试大型双花钱交易-这反过来又转向对隐秘交易的攻击。大部分资金已经转移到其他地址，只有大约12000个BTG留在账户中。“一个有针对性的交易所报告了TH。EY强烈认为，这名攻击者试图在过去的BTC双重打击下打击他们，“比特币黄金队说。”在他们的话中，“我们100%确定它是同一个人，我们发现了许多帐户之间的关联。”比特币黄金小组说，计划在六月底的一个大升级——现在被催促尽快进行——将彻底消除ASIC硬件的使用。BTG ASIC系统预计将在同一时间发货，并有可能导致现有矿工的不平衡，因此，团队正在篡改BTG算法来防止这种情况发生。在未来的日子里，我们要冒着51%次攻击的风险。“过去几天我们一直在以令人难以置信的速度把计划和碎片放在一起，我们希望在必要的软件在我们的测试网上运行并运行七天后升级我们的主干网。”团队说。（虽然……最好给我们的伙伴七天以上的时间来测试和部署，以避免破坏，这些攻击已经对我们所有人都造成了破坏，所以我们认为最好尽快完成升级。”根据反钓鱼工作组，RE。美分的估计表明，自2017以来，网络攻击者已经设法从交易所、初始投币产品（ICOS）、钱包等中窃取了12亿美元。最近一种类似的攻击方法被应用于VRGE，这是一种声称要带回A的加密服务。无名一次与一个整体密码学相关。
t Bitcoin Gold (BTG) appears to be the target of a 51 percent attack, leading to the theft of approximately $17.5 million from cryptocurrency exchanges.Traders of the coin, Scrutiny of unusual activity on the network has revealed the scheme, in which "double spending" attacks have been launched against cryptocurrency exchanges trading the virtual currency.According The first attack was recorded on 16 May and have now appeared to have ceased."An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use "51 percent attacks" to perform "double spend" attacks to steal money from exchanges," the team says. "We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits. There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held."51 percent attacks force reorganization in the blockchain. While not the result of a security flaw or vulnerabilities, the attack can -- theoretically -- be launched against any blockchain.If a threat actor manages to wrestle control of over 50 percent of a network's computing power, they are able to both modify and exclude transactions of their own coins from blocks.Attackers are then able to double spend, in which transactions are reversed after being confirmed, as well as prevent all other miners on a network from mining valid blocks.Launching these types of attacks can be expensive and due to the vast computing power required, the only way they are made profitable is to attempt large double spend transactions -- and this, in turn, pivots attacks towards cryptocurrency exchanges.The The majority of the funds have been moved to other addresses and only roughly 12,000 BTG remains in the account."One of the targeted exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past," the Bitcoin Gold team says. "In their words, "we are 100 percent sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts."The Bitcoin Gold team says that a major upgrade planned for the end of June -- now being pushed to take place as soon as possible -- will eradicate the use of ASIC hardware to mine BTG.ASIC systems are expected to ship at approximately the same time and have the potential to cause an imbalance to existing miners, and therefore, the team is tampering with the BTG algorithm to prevent this from occurring.The organization says that the change in algorithm and a new fork will also reduce the risk of 51 percent attacks in the future."We've been working at an incredible pace the past days to put the plan and pieces together, and we expect to upgrade our mainnet approximately seven days after the necessary software is up and running on our testnet," the team says. "[...] While it would be better to give all our partners more than seven days to test and deploy to avoid disruption, these attacks have already forced disruption on us all, so we feel it's best to get the upgrade completed as soon as we possibly can."According to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, recent estimates suggest that since 2017, cyberattackers have managed to steal $1.2 billion in cryptocurrencies from exchanges, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), wallets, and more.A similar attack method has recently been employed against Verge, a cryptocurrency offering which claims to bring back the anonymity once associated with cryptocurrency as a whole.
