亚太地区的企业仍然没有及时交换足够的信息和披露违规行为。事实上，微软亚洲首席网络安全官Michael Montoya说，威胁行动者“走出去”并不一定是因为他们更聪明，而是因为他们更有效地合作。在需要许可和政府官员责任的服务种类方面仍存在问题，但拟议的立法有一点是明确的：网络安全必须成为新加坡任何经营关键基础设施的首要任务。分享和分享，这也使得归属难以确定，”他说。就我们而言，我们并没有分享足够的情报，也没有作为一个团体来分享关于攻击和破坏的情报。“蒙托亚说，在披露信息的重要性时，这将触发组织和消费者在发现漏洞时需要采取的步骤。他说，尽管这一地区的密码是全球最受攻击的，但他指出，微软最新的安全情报报告指出，该地区面临着最高的勒索企图和地点，这是此类事件中最高的。包括缅甸和Bagladesh。他指出，亚洲越来越受到黑客的欢迎，原因是中产阶级的壮大和数字转型的加速。它也是一些增长最快的经济体的家园，比如东南亚市场。所以它的攻击面正在不断增长，但是如果你有一个古老的防御姿态，那么黑客会利用它。然而，事情开始发生变化，ISP和CERP（计算机应急响应小组）在垂直工业中分享更多的数据和口袋，合作更多，他还强调了微软的人工智能（AI）的信念，“在这150亿个方面，”黑客们只需要正确一次[造成伤害]。在一天结束的时候，我们的人工智能系统将帮助我们赢得这场战斗。除了在规模上执行的能力之外，他还指出，人工智能工具也丰富了防御能力，并提供了可以用来进一步增强网络的数据洞察力。此外，人工智能有助于建立攻击模式和识别新的威胁，以及检测异常的用户行为，这些行为可能被标记为潜在的违反。他补充说，网络钓鱼仍然是一种有效的策略，用来穿透公司系统，因为黑客们的目的是利用链条中最薄弱的环节——人类。然而，当员工也是公司最大的资产时，妨碍他们的生产能力不是一个组织的利益。相反，企业应该部署自动防御机制，包括沙箱，这样，在到达用户收件箱之前，电子邮件的潜在风险和恶意软件可以被过滤掉，他说。更重要的是，员工还需要更多的信息和意识到似乎不合适的事情，他补充说。据蒙托亚说，黑客正在把他们的注意力从基于文件的攻击转移到不同的基于文件的攻击，这些攻击可以通过安全工具、无攻击攻击、已经安装在系统上的应用程序和白名单上的应用程序来检测。当被问及他作为CSO的主要关注点时，微软的执行官在政府规章中指出了“灰色地带”，这些规则需要澄清，而企业担心网络安全风险，反而选择阻止他们的数字改造工作。他还强调，需要更有效地使用人工智能来更好地预测攻击，并基于这些洞察力建立更好的用户行为模型。
Businesses in Asia-Pacific still are not exchanging enough information and disclosing breaches in a timely fashion. In fact, threat actors are "out-evolving" the industry not necessarily because they are smarter, but because they are collaborating more effectively, according to Michael Montoya, Microsoft Asia's chief cybersecurity officer. Questions remain over the kinds of services that will require a license and government officials' liability, but the proposed legislation is clear in one thing--that cybersecurity must now be a top priority for any business operating critical infrastructures in Singapore."They are actively collaborating and sharing, which also makes attribution tough to determine," he said. "On our part, we don't share enough intelligence and aren't coming together as a community to share intelligence on attacks and breaches."Elaborating on the importance of disclosure, Montoya said this would trigger the steps organisations and consumers needed to take as soon a breach was detected, such as changing their passwords.And despite the fact that the region was the most frequently attacked globally, he said Pointing to Microsoft's latest Security Intelligence Report, he said the region faced the highest number of ransomware attempts and locations that had the highest of such incidents included Myanmar and Bagladesh. He noted that Asia was popular amongst hackers due to its growing middle-class and accelerated digital transformation. It also was home to some of the fastest-growing economies, such as Southeast Asian markets. "So its attack surface are is constantly growing, but if you have an archaic defence posture, then hackers will take advantage of that," he said. Things were starting to change, though, with ISPs and CERTs (computer emergency response teams) sharing more data and pockets of businesses within vertical industries collaborating more, he noted.He also underscored Microsoft's belief that artificial intelligence (AI) and "Out of this 15 billion, [hackers] only need to be right once [to cause damage]". At the end of the day, it's our AI system that will help us win this battle," he said. Apart from its ability to perform at scale, he noted that AI tools also enriched defence capabilities and offered data insights that then could be used to further beef up networks. In addition, AI helped establish attack patterns and identify new threats, as well as detect unusual user behaviour that could be flagged as a potential breach. He added that phishing still was an effective tactic used to penetrate corporate systems because hackers aimed to exploit the weakest link of the chain--humans. However, as employees also were a company's greatest asset, it would not be an organisation's interest to hinder their ability to be productive. Instead, businesses should deploy automated defense mechanisms including sandboxing so email carrying potential risks and malware could be filtered out before reaching the user's inbox, he said. More importantly, employees also need to be more informed and aware of things that seemed out of place, he added. According to Montoya, hackers were shifting their focus from file-based attacks to Unlike file-based attacks, which could be detected by security tools, fileless attacks used applications that already were installed on the system and on whitelists. Asked what were his key concerns as CSO, the Microsoft executive pointed to "grey areas" around government regulations that needed clarification and businesses that, worried about cybersecurity risks, chose instead to hold back their digital transformation efforts. He also stressed the need to use AI more effectively to better predict attacks and establish better user behavioural models based on the insights.
