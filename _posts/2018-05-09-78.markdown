The internet was built in a great utopian, engineering vision and it wasnÂt built with the idea that people would do things with it.ÂWe are desperately trying to retrofit security and a lot of people are getting a lot of commercial benefit from that, he said.ÂI think the real challenge is to make sure we donÂt repeat those mistakes in the future. How do we do the researching now and build the security now to make sure that people donÂt look back in 20 yearsÂ time and say that when the IoT explosion happened we hadnÂt thought about security?Â he asked.Hannigan said we could amplify the problem weÂve already got by dumping billions of new processes into the network without any care for security.There is still plenty to do in research, he added, and there is a need to Âtake some of the responsibility away from the individual. ItÂs not that individuals donÂt need to care about it, but weÂve got to get the right balance between what can be built into hardware securityÂ so we can take away from the individual a lot of the worries about that.ÂThereÂs never been a more exciting time to be doing research in this area, and for that reason there is an opportunity here to get the future right in a way that the past wasnÂt,Â he concluded.
