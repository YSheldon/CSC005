人力资源软件公司PaulUp可能会发现自己遭遇了一场集体诉讼，在本周早些时候透露，它有百年律师，去年根据悉尼总部的法律公司提交了一份报告，可能遭受恶意软件攻击的公司包括WESFAR。Mers拥有Cules、Talk、KMART和Office Word；澳大利亚国家银行（NAB）；Telstra；澳大利亚储备银行；澳大利亚邮政；MyBank；ABC；澳大利亚红十字会和塔斯马尼亚大学。“雇主有责任保持高度个人信息的机密性，不仅是O。他们的工人，也是那些申请工作的人。“这通常包括财务信息，甚至是作为诱导过程的一部分所需的医疗信息，”百年律师首席律师George Newhouse教授说，“公司和那些为他们提供服务的公司必须采取适当的措施来保护他们的雇员或雇员。”重要的员工信息。这起案件凸显了如果安全遭到破坏，可以做的损害。“由于PageUp的信息处理不当，在海外的集体诉讼案在本周早些时候证实，它在IT基础设施上发现了不寻常的活动，这导致了潜在的妥协。客户端数据。5月23日，SaaS提供商称，在系统上发现恶意软件后，它立即发起了法医调查。五天后，PaulUp称其怀疑已得到证实，调查揭示了“一些指标”，客户数据可能受到损害。“如果任何个人数据受到影响，它可以包括诸如姓名和联系细节等信息。它还可以包括识别和认证数据，例如加密和加密的用户名和密码，“该公司在一份声明中说，”没有证据表明仍然存在一个积极的威胁，并且工作网站可以继续使用。我们数据库中的所有客户端用户和候选密码都使用BLIPT和咸的方式进行了散列；然而，出于大量的谨慎，我们建议用户更改密码。“NAB采取主动措施，在本周早些时候暂停使用Pay-Up，银行首席隐私官Jade Ha。AR说，一个积极的调查已经开始确定什么数据，如果有的话，已经受到影响。“在大多数情况下，个人信息可能受到影响的是申请人的姓名，电话号码，应用历史和电子邮件地址，”Telstra同样写道。对于那些申请成功的人，PageUp的系统中的数据可以包括：出生日期、就业提供细节、雇员数量（如果是当前或以前的雇员）、就业前检查结果、以及（裁判）细节。“澳大利亚的澳大利亚信息委员会办公室。ER（OAIC）——处理NDB计划——本周早些时候发布了一份声明，确认它与PageUp和澳大利亚网络安全中心就这起事件进行了接触。
Human resources software firm PageUp could find itself up against a class action lawsuit, after it revealed earlier this week it had Centennial Lawyers, which last year filed a According to the Sydney-based law firm, companies that may have suffered at the hands of the malware attack include Wesfarmers-owned Coles, Target, Kmart, and Officeworks; the National Australia Bank (NAB); Telstra; the Reserve Bank of Australia; Australia Post; Medibank; the ABC; the Australian Red Cross; and the University of Tasmania."Employers owe a duty to keep highly personal information confidential, not only of their workers but also those that are applying for work. This can often include financial information and even medical information required as part of an induction process," principal solicitor of Centennial Lawyers A/Prof. George Newhouse said."Companies, and those that provide services to them, must take adequate steps to protect their employees' or potential employees' information. This case highlights the damage that can be done if security is breached."Citing class action cases overseas due to the mishandling of information by PageUp confirmed earlier this week it found "unusual" activity on its IT infrastructure last month, which has resulted in the potential compromise of client data.On May 23, the SaaS provider said it immediately launched a forensic investigation after malware was spotted on its system. Five days later PageUp said its suspicions were confirmed, with investigations revealing "some indicators" that client data may have been compromised."If any personal data has been affected it could include information such as name and contact details. It could also include identification and authentication data e.g. usernames and passwords which are encrypted (hashed and salted)," the company said in a statement."There is no evidence that there is still an active threat, and the jobs website can continue to be used. All client user and candidate passwords in our database are hashed using bcrypt and salted; however, out of an abundance of caution, we suggest users change their password."NAB took the proactive measure to suspended its use of PageUp earlier this week, with the bank's chief privacy officer Jade Haar saying an active investigation has commenced to ascertain what data, if any, has been affected."In most cases, the personal information that could be potentially impacted is the applicant's name, phone number, application history, and email address," Telstra similarly wrote. "For those whose applications were successful, the data in PageUp's systems may include: Date of birth, employment offer details, employee number (if a current or previous employee), pre-employment check outcomes, [and] referee details."Australia's The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) -- which handles the NDB scheme -- issued a statement earlier this week confirming it is in contact with PageUp and the Australian Cyber Security Centre about the incident.
