In order to take the courses, candidates must first undergo a rigorous selection process that assures they are the proper match for the training.I was proud to serve my country and I wanted to give something back to the military for all the skills and experiences the Marines gave me, and I know my colleagues feel the same, Crucial Groups chief executive and former Royal Marine Commando Captain Neil Williams said in a press release.People who have spent time in the forces have an incredible work ethic, resilience and a security-driven mindset that makes many very well suited to a career in cybersecurity," Williams continued. "Following my experience of leaving the forces, I know that the transition can be very challenging. Were pleased to be able to help give them a pathway into a successful career  and in a sector where they can make such a difference.After successful completion of the training, qualified Crucial Academy candidates are introduced to a cybersecurity career with one of the academys commercial partners, an additional offering that also benefits businesses by helping them to meet their growing demand for qualified cybersecurity personnel.
