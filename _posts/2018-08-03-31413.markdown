The U.S. Postal Service is tossing around ideas to better engage Millennials, including some pretty flashy technology.Augmented reality postcards and digitally interactive stamps arent the norm just yet, but theyre two of the concepts discussed in an online discussion board that the Postal Services Inspector General used to glean insights as to what Millennials want.
