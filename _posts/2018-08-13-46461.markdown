Meanwhile, outside of the desertPhoto-slinging biz Snapchat had a pretty rough week, as a mystery code dump on GitHub turned out to be a chunk of the source for its iOS mobile app. The internal source code stayed up for a few days, and some users speculated as to whether it was genuine.That question was answered when Snapchat filed a The code snippet was reportedly taken from a buggy update issued for the iOS app back in May.Web hosting biz GoDaddy accidentally left an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket open to the world that Medical device maker MedTronic is under fire for Infosec bods Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts reported the flaws over a year ago to the manufacturer, and We're told miscreants can, over the air, stop vulnerable pumps from delivering insulin, or inject unexpected doses. Hackers can also insert malware into the firmware of a vulnerable pacemaker to disrupt its operation. Such attacks in the real world would be rather debilitating for a patient.The insulin pumps can be screwed around by someone within wireless range. The pacemaker was infected by reprogramming it using a terminal doctors use to monitor and configure patients' devices. The software on the terminal had to be altered to achieve this, which required physical access. Alternatively, someone on the local network could intercept and tamper with the firmware as it was downloaded to the programmer via the internet.MedTronic said the insulin pump in question, apart from not being generally available at least in the US anymore, does not accept over-the-air commands by default, requires replaying radio signals to exploit, and will alert the user of the change in dosage. Rios and Butts argued that the equipment should in any case implement stronger authorization mechanisms for wireless-issued orders.Similarly, the duo said the pacemakers should only accept firmware cryptographically signed by MedTronic, rather than any old code, when being updated by their reprogramming terminal. MedTronic dismissed malicious reprogramming as an impractical attack, and "low risk," adding that patients should be safe if they and their doctors ensure the reprogramming terminals remain unhacked. Tell that to the hospitals hit by ransomeware.The manufacturer has emitted a bunch of advisories lately for its products regarding the pair's discoveries:"Additionally, successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker with local network access to influence communications between the Programmer and the software deployment network." That means it's possible for someone on the local network to tamper with pacemaker firmware as it is downloaded to the programmer. Changes were made server-side to thwart this meddling. (Whether exploiting these is easier or harder than just stabbing, shooting, or poisoning a victim is an exercise we'll leave to, er, well, hopefully no one.Shortly before everyone headed off to catch their Vegas flights, an interesting new security and debugging tool was dropped for Windows 10.Alex Ionescu's Ionescu, who has made "For advanced troubleshooting, IT experts will typically use tools such as the Windows Debugger (WinDbg), SysInternals Tools, or write their own," the guru explained. "Unfortunately, usage of these tools is getting increasingly hard, and they are themselves limited by their own access to Windows APIs and exposed features."Speaking of Windows, a desktop sandboxing feature may have been Researchers looking to make a living from bug discoveries will have one more place to do business this fall.Exploit-brokers Crowdfense "Through the VRP, Crowdfense experts work in real time with researchers to evaluate, test, document and refine their findings," said Crowdfense director Andrea Zapparoli Manzoni."The findings can be both within the scope of Crowdfense public Bug Bounty Program or freely proposed by researchers (for a specific set of key targets)."From the sound of things, Crowdfense wants to make it easier for researchers to report and get top dollar for their discoveries. While this might bring to mind images of covert government exchanges, more likely the buyers will be the companies themselves or security firms looking to tout protection from the latest high-profile security holes.Stop us if you've heard this one: Comcast has done something else to piss off customers who will have little recourse.This time, the cable giant has Apparently the holes have both been patched, and even when open an attacker would have been unable to get anything more than partial data for either the address or the social security number. But this is going to be yet another bit of bad press for a company that already has an awful reputation with customers.If you're stationed abroad, you may no longer be able to post humblebrags about your daily workouts.That's because the Department of Defense has The reason is easy enough to understand: Trackers and exercise apps will often share GPS coordinates and other location that would possibly allow a hostile party to track, in some cases even pinpoint, a person's location at any given time.The Pentagon says discretion on the ban will be given to military commanders and department heads, who will get to determine just how much info about the day's workout their subordinates can safely share.This week in "forgot to set any sort of security on the cloud database", we have Hova Health, a medical provider and unwitting records dealer from Mexico.Diachenko estimates that, in total, around 2.3 million people in Mexico had their name, gender, national ID number, insurance details, date of birth, and home address left sitting out in the open. Diachenko said he notified the company and it is reviewing the incident. Hopefully that includes learning how to set access policies on its databases. Ž
