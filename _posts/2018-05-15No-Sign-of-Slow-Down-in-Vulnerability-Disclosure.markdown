Yet the number of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities continues to rise. In fact, according to the The report looked at 5,375 vulnerabilities published during the first three months of 2018 and found an increase of 1.8% over the same period last year. Of all the Q1 disclosures, eight vendors accounted for 22.9% of the vulnerabilities.Risk Based Security published 1,790 more vulnerabilities than common vulnerability exposures (CVEs) in Q1, suggesting that "organizations relying on CVE or sources solely obtaining data from CVE are missing a significant number of disclosed vulnerabilities," the report said.Additionally, web-related vulnerabilities represent almost half (47.5%) of all Q1 2018 vulnerabilities and 49.1% of all publicly disclosed vulnerabilities able to be remotely exploited."As more and more vulnerabilities are reported, organizations are forced to spend an increasing amount of time and resources to stay properly informed about the weaknesses affecting their IT infrastructure and applications," the report said. Organizations continue to grapple with vulnerability intelligence. Vulnerability disclosure and the issue of organizations better managing vulnerabilities are what many are looking to address of late.A new report from Kenna Security and In 2017, businesses were challenged with addressing an average of 40 new vulnerabilities every day, and 2018 is expected to meet or exceed those numbers. Yet "out of the thousands of new vulnerabilities published every year, the vast majority (77%) never have exploits developed, and even fewer (less than 2%) are actively used in an attack," the reported stated.“Effective remediation depends on quickly determining which vulnerabilities warrant action and which of those have highest priority, but prioritization remains one of the biggest challenges in vulnerability management,' Karim Toubba, CEO, Kenna Security said in a
