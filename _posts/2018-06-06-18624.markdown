ContractsThe Navy on June 1 unveiled the final solicitation for the next iteration of its massive SeaPort contracting vehicle for professional services.SeaPort Next Generation will have a $21 billion ceiling over up to 10 years with a five-year base period followed by another five-year option period, according to Deltek data. Proposals for SeaPort-NxG are due to the Naval Sea Systems Command by 2 p.m. Eastern time on July 2, according to the solicitation notice NAVSEA plans to start awards of task orders for services at the start of the 2019 fiscal year that begins in September, the command said in a release. An on-ramp process is scheduled to commence two years later for those who do not qualify for the initial source selection process.The successor to ÂSeaPort-e,Â this new iteration requires prospective bidders to prove their work experience within the past 10 years that directly supports the Navy. That experience can include work as a prime or subcontractor.SeaPort-e started in 2001 and includes thousands of contractors as participants.NAVSEA also removed regional zone presence requirements for the new NxG version, which lets all vehicle awardees compete for any task order.Seaport-NXG divides 23 functional areas of work into two scope categories of engineering services and program management. Prospective bidders must include in their proposal any experience related to those 23 functional areas. Experience for other federal agencies outside the Navy will not be sufficient, NAVSEA said.Large businesses that plan to subcontract work must submit a plan for enlisting small businesses, and proposals from joint ventures will not be considered.About the AuthorSign up for our newsletter.ttI agree to this site's
