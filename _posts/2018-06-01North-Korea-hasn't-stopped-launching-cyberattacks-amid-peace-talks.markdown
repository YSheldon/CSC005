As Kim Jong-un Experts from several cybersecurity firms — Dell SecureWorks, McAfee, Symantec, FireEye and Recorded Future — all told CyberScoop that activity from North Korea has stayed steady or grown in volume since peace talks gained steam earlier this year.The activities of these “Similar to operations conducted prior to that date [circa January], North Korean actors have engaged in broad cyber espionage using a “We have seen a heavy concentration of targeting in Southeast Asia and the United States, with some cross over into the Middle East,” McAfee Senior Researcher Ryan Sherstobitoff said. “We have even seen an entire country’s financial sector targeted by Hidden Cobra during this period.”Hidden Cobra is one of the nicknames assigned by the U.S. government to North Korea’s hacking activities; other names authored by the private sector include “Lazarus Group,” “Blue Nortoff” and “Red Eyes.”On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation “The group continues to use implants The findings, shared with CyberScoop, provide a stark reminder that North Korea remains highly dependent on cybercrime for both financial and geopolitical gain, so much so in that they’re willing to risk angering foreign governments amid a diplomatic push.“During the past few months we’ve seen Lazarus conduct attacks on financial organizations, with the intention of attempting bank heists,” said Vikram Thakur of Symantec’s Security Response team. “The volume of these attacks is not massive but the trend reflects a small uptick in overall attacks and attempts of financial fraud.”The diplomatic talks regarding North Korea involve several key countries, including China, Russia, South Korea and the U.S. A number of research teams see the U.S. and South Korea still being targeted.“During the timeframe, North Korea had been focusing their attention to South Korean targets, specifically North Korean defectors and related organizations for intelligence gathering,” a spokesperson for SecureWorks’ Counter Threat Unit said. “Based on targeting select victims, it appears that the [North Korean] government is keen to acquire information that could affect current peace process … We have not directly observed but are aware of phishing lures containing topics concerning current peace talks.”North Korea’s use of these diplomatically inspired phishing emails was not previously known.How the small, resource-strapped nation will move away from this type of behavior if it is to improve foreign partnerships is an open-ended question, experts say.The challenge is especially significant because of the decentralized nature of North Korea’s hacking units. Prior “DPRK cyber espionage operations continue to increase in scope and sophistication, developing new offensive capabilities and leveraging zero day vulnerabilities,” said Cristiana Brafman Kittner, principal security analyst at FireEye. These financially motivated intrusions have continued during the run up to a potential Kim – Trump summit.”On Wednesday, top North Korean and U.S. government officials met in Singapore to discuss next steps in the negotiations, according The meeting was held New Jersey-based cybersecurity firm Comodo saw an increase following a meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Kim on May 9. Such detections could suggest one of two things: that the country is itself being hacked or that hackers inside North Korea are testing their own tools internally before operating abroad.A Comodo employee provided CyberScoop with a company presentation that showed this activity:“Comodo has security software (and thus malware detections) inside North Korea,” said Kenneth Geers, chief scientist at Comodo.In early MaySouth Korea’s Financial Security Institute, a leading player in thwarting North Korean cyber aggression, did not respond to a request for comment.
