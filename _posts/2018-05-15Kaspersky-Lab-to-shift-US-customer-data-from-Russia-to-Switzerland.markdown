星期二，网络安全公司说，“一些核心流程”将从俄罗斯转移，包括客户数据存储系统和“针对大多数地区的处理”。2019年底，卡巴斯基实验室希望移动用于美国客户数据存储和处理的基础设施。去苏黎世。来自欧洲、新加坡、澳大利亚、日本和韩国的客户数据也将被移动，其他国家也会跟进。该公司总部设在俄罗斯莫斯科，称该过渡是全球透明度倡议的一部分。2017，美国国土安全部（DHS）下令FE。根据该机构的机构，俄罗斯法律允许克里姆林宫潜伏在卡巴斯基实验室，进行网络间谍活动，拦截与俄罗斯网络连接的通信。国土安全部建议，由于这些法律，俄罗斯政府可以将卡巴斯基产品作为一个骗局。网络安全公司坚决否认这些指控，并与“包括俄罗斯在内的任何政府”有不适当的联系。“新措施是该倡议的下一步发展，但也反映了公司的承诺。网络安全公司说：“与他人合作，解决行业碎片化和信任崩溃的挑战。”信任在网络安全中是必不可少的，卡巴斯基实验室明白信任不是一个给定的；它必须通过透明和问责制来重复获得。“卡巴斯基也打算将用于组装软件的工具重新定位到苏黎世，到2018年底，该公司称Ka都是。SpabkyLab产品和威胁检测规则数据库将开始在国内进行组装和签署。“重新定位将确保所有新组装的软件可以由一个独立的组织验证，并表明客户所接收的软件构建和更新与S相匹配。“OURCE代码提供了审计，”Kaspersky补充说，系统和数据的转换将由位于瑞士的一个未命名的独立第三方监督。此外，网络安全公司承诺今年在瑞士开设第一个透明中心。最终，该中心将使卡巴斯基产品的源代码可供利益相关者审查。“在像我们这样快速变化的行业中，我们必须适应我们的客户、利益相关者和合作伙伴的不断发展的需要，”卡巴斯基实验室的首席执行官Eugene Kaspersky说，“透明度是一个这样的需要，这就是为什么我们决定重新设计我们的基础设施，并把我们的数据处理设施转移到瑞士。我们相信，这样的行动将成为全球网络安全的趋势，信任政策将成为整个行业的一个关键基本要求。
tOn Tuesday, the cybersecurity firm said that "a number of core processes" will be shifted from Russia, including customer data storage systems and processing "for most regions."By the end of 2019, Kaspersky Lab hopes to have moved the infrastructure used for US customer data storage and processing to Zurich. Customer data from Europe, Singapore, Australia, Japan, and South Korea will also be moved, with other countries to follow.The company, headquartered in Moscow, Russia, says the transition is part of the Global Transparency Initiative.In 2017, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ordered federal agencies to According to the agency, Russian laws allows the Kremlin to potentially lean on Kaspersky Lab to perform cyberespionage and intercept communications connected to Russian networks.The DHS suggested that due to these laws, the Russian government could use Kaspersky products as a conduit to compromise US national security.The cybersecurity firm has firmly denied these accusations, as well as having "inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia."The "The new measures are the next steps in the development of the initiative, but they also reflect the company's commitment to working with others to address the growing challenges of industry fragmentation and a breakdown of trust," the cybersecurity firm says. "Trust is essential in cybersecurity, and Kaspersky Lab understands that trust is not a given; it must be repeatedly earned through transparency and accountability."Kaspersky also intends to relocate the tools used to assemble software to Zurich, and by the end of 2018, the company says that both Kaspersky Lab products and threat detection rule databases will begin to be assembled and signed off in the country."The relocation will ensure that all newly assembled software can be verified by an independent organization, and show that software builds and updates received by customers match the source code provided for audit," Kaspersky added.The transition of systems and data will be overseen by an unnamed independent third party that is based in Switzerland. In addition, the cybersecurity firm has pledged to open its first Transparency Center in Switzerland this year. Eventually, the center will make the source code of Kaspersky products available for review by stakeholders."In a rapidly changing industry such as ours, we have to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients, stakeholders and partners," said Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky Lab. "Transparency is one such need, and that is why we've decided to redesign our infrastructure and move our data processing facilities to Switzerland. We believe such action will become a global trend for cybersecurity, and that a policy of trust will catch on across the industry as a key basic requirement."
