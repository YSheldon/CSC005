A new global software supply chain survey from CrowdStrikeŽ, conducted by independent research firm The global impact of events such as last years In order to fully appreciate the findings in this survey, its important to understand what a supply chain attack is and why they are increasing. Enhancements in security technology such as machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and global reputation systems have made it harder for unwanted, unknown or malicious applications to give attackers a foothold in the environments they are targeting. The logical next step for them is to get upstream and infect a legitimate, trusted application. To accomplish this, attackers are increasingly targeting software makers. Once a supplier is compromised, the attackers can modify trusted products to perform malicious actions or provide a backdoor to the target environment. Unaware of these malicious changes to their applications, suppliers unwittingly deliver them to their trusting clients as legitimate software updates. We saw a number of these appear in headlines last year.Widespread incidents such as the The following are some recommendations for how organizations can increase their security and avoid becoming the victim of a supply chain attack:The survey found that on average, it takes respondents 10 hours to detect an attack, 13 hours to react to it and 15 hours to respond. In all, this means it requires a total of 63 hours for those surveyed to return their environments to the state they were in before the attack   thats two and half days, working around the clock.These metrics are significant because they differ widely from the key metrics CrowdStrike believes organizations must observe to effectively respond to an attack. Chief among them is breakout time, which CrowdStrike revealed in the Finding a solution that can help you meet these time windows is critical to closing the security gaps that leave organizations vulnerable to supply chain attacks.CrowdStrikeŽ is thrilled to introduce Falcon Discover for AWS, a new solution that delivers our next-generationtttttttttttttttttttttBreaches Are Plentiful, But Dont Panic With breaches disclosed almost daily, it can sometimes feel likettttttttttttttttttttt"CrowdStrike Falcon continues to amaze us here at SC Labs.
