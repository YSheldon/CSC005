GDPR仅仅几天的时间，但组织仍在努力满足符合数据保护法规的要求。企业技术供应商正在排队自动化工具和人工智能，以期在2018年5月25日之前寻求符合GDPR的客户。欧盟发现那些不符合GDPR的组织如果发现滥用、剥削、丢失或以其他方式处理个人数据，将面临罚款。经济处罚可能会达到公司营业额的百分之四——对任何组织来说都是一笔可观的金额。然而，根据全球专业服务和咨询公司EY的报告，三分之二的组织仍然发现要遵守标准和多大的挑战。除此之外，在所有被调查者中，大多数人表示，将采取“适度的努力”来执行GDPR要求，以满足通知欧盟公民的个人数据被处理和出于什么目的的期望。ErStutoug LLP的执行董事Chris Ritterbush说，当GDPR这样的信息仍然是一个重大的挑战时，当验证第三方直接收集来自欧盟公民的个人信息时，得到了同意。EYED公司表示，他们有这种能力。几乎一半的人表示，仍然需要大量的时间来满足这一要求——百分之五的公司将从头开始建设能力，而43%的公司则表明，他们将需要对现有能力进行重大改进。GDPR的一个重要组成部分将意味着遭受个人数据破坏的组织将不得不通知欧盟客户在72小时内了解到事件发生。然而，尽管未能做到这一点，可能会导致巨额罚款，几乎一半的受访者表示，他们需要实施重大的改进，以满足这一GDPR标准。只有百分之五的人表示他们已经具备了能力，但据EY所说，组织数量最多的地区是那些被调查者，没有组织说他们有这个能力，而14%的组织表示他们需要建立CAPA。尽管从GDPR不到几天的时间，EY报告表明，组织仍在努力保持顺从性，这一问题将在一段时间内无法解决。“鉴于这些挑战，与监管的更广泛影响相配。报告指出，在短期内，遵守两年的窗口，组织将需要在未来的一年中花费大量精力和精力。
GDPR is just days away, but organisations are still struggling to meet the requirements for compliance with the incoming data protection legislation.Enterprise technology vendors are lining up automated tools and artificial intelligence to land customers looking to comply with GDPR by May 25, 2018.The European Union's Those organisations found not to be compliant with GDPR could face fines if found to misuse, exploit, lose, or otherwise mishandle personal data. The financial penalty could potentially reach four percent of company turnover -- a significant amount for any organisation.However, according to a report by global professional services and consultancy firm EY, two-thirds of organisations are still finding it a challenge to be compliant and much more needs to be done in order to meet the requirements.In addition to this, of all those surveyed, the majority said it will take a "moderate effort" to implement GDPR requirements for addressing expectations of informing EU citizens where their personal data is processed and for what purpose."Regulations such as GDPR continue to be a significant challenge," said Chris Ritterbush, executive director at ErnstYoung LLP.When it comes to verifying that third parties directly gathering personal information from EU citizens obtain consent -- as is dictated by GDPR -- none of the organisations surveyed said they have this capability in place.Almost half suggested it is still going to take a lot to become compliant with this requirement --five percent of firms will be building capabilities from scratch, while 43 percent reveal it will require major enhancements to their existing capabilities.One of the key components of GDPR will mean organisations that suffer a personal data breach will have to notify EU customers that an incident has occurred within 72 hours of learning about it. However, even though failure to do this could result in a hefty fine, almost half of those surveyed said they need to implement major enhancements in order to meet this GDPR criteria. Just five percent said they already have the capabilities in place.But the area where the highest number of organisations are having the most difficulty, according to EY, is Of those surveyed, no organisations said they had this capability in place, while 14 percent said they need to build the capabilities from scratch and will have difficulty doing so.Despite GDPR being just days away, the EY report suggests that organisations are still struggling to become compliant -- and the problem won't be resolved for some time."Given these challenges, paired with the broader impact of the regulation and the short two-year window for compliance, organisations will need to expend significant energy and effort in the coming year," said the report.A recent UK government
