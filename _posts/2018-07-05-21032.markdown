Their ambitious aims for growth are very much aligned with our own, so we are eagerly anticipating the impact they will have on the success of the wider Group.NotSoSecures Siddharth added: Since we established the business, the risk of cyber-attacks for organizations around the world has grown exponentially. However, this has not been matched by an increase in training and knowledge and, as a result, there is now a severe global skills shortage in cybersecurity.We are delighted to add our specialist, hands-on training and pen testing expertise to Claranets portfolio of services and look forward to extending our reach, so businesses can develop their capabilities and stay secure.
