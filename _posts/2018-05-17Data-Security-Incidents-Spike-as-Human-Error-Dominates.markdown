Although cybersecurity-related incidents increased by 31% from the previous quarter, the first month-on-month increase since Q4 2016-17, human error dominated.In fact, over the 2017-18 financial year, 3325 reports were The healthcare sector accounted for by far the largest volume of reports (37%), although this figure is likely to be a result of mandatory reporting rules. After health came “general business” (11%), education (11%) and local government (10%).“Interestingly, there are far more incidents caused by human error than there are external cyber-threats, suggesting that a lot more work needs to be done on training employees,” he added.“Often, however, cyber-threats can lay unnoticed for months or even years and so this data may well be skewed towards incidents that are immediately identifiable. This information should not, therefore, lure anyone into a false sense of security. We’d encourage all organizations across the UK to up their vigilance against any and all threats, whether that’s external threats lying dormant or unwitting employees making mistakes.” "Now the GDPR is upon us, it is more imperative than ever that organizations adopt an approach that’s focused on users, working out what technology and support they can give their employees to help them handle data safely at work,” he added.
