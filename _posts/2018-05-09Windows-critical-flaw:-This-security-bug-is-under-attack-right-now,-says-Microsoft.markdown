微软的补丁星期二更新解决了Windows VBScript引擎的一个关键缺陷，攻击者正在使用它通过Internet Explorer妥协Windows机器。该补丁遵循QiHoO 360核心安全研究人员的警报，IE攻击被称为“双杀”，是通过在后台打开恶意网页的Office文档传递的。微软尚未证实这是奇虎360核心安全报告中的漏洞，但指出该漏洞在野外被开发利用。在一个基于网络的攻击场景中，攻击者可以拥有一个专门制作的网站，该网站旨在通过Internet Explorer开发漏洞，然后说服用户查看网站。攻击者还可以嵌入一个ActiveX控件，该控件在一个托管IE渲染引擎的应用程序或微软Office文档中被标记为“安全初始化”。“观察到的攻击是从恶意Word文档开始的，该文件在打开时下载了一个托管在VBScript中的漏洞。在一个网页上，分析家们也确信他们发现的漏洞与“双杀”奇虎360核心安全报告相同。虽然零日攻击很可能是国家资助的攻击者的工作，卡巴斯基实验室预测它将成为网络罪犯的一部分，作为一个开发工具包的一部分，用于攻击基于Windows的攻击中的Windows PC。这是因为该技术允许攻击者强制IE到L。OAD和利用未修补机器上的漏洞，即使受害者已经设置了Chrome或Firefox作为默认浏览器。“尽管Word文档是最初的攻击向量，但该漏洞实际上是在VBScript中，而不是在微软Word中。这是我们第一次看到一个用于加载IE漏洞的URL名字，并且我们相信这种技术将来会被恶意软件作者大量使用。该技术允许使用IE引擎加载和呈现网页，即使受害者机器上的默认浏览器设置为不同的东西，“分析家说。我们希望这个漏洞在不久的将来成为最被开发的工具之一，因为开发工具包的作者在通过浏览器和鱼叉网络钓鱼这两个驱动程序开始滥用它的时间不会太长。“微软证实的另一个漏洞目前正在被开发。一个Wi32 K的特权漏洞，它被跟踪为CVE-2018－8120，并被认为是重要的。“要利用这个漏洞，攻击者首先必须登录到系统。攻击者然后可以运行一个特殊的应用程序，可以利用漏洞和控制受影响的系统，“微软注意到。微软也绕过微软修补了67个漏洞在五月补丁星期二更新，其中21被评为关键。微软被催促在互联网探险家中使用一个漏洞，用于攻击。谷歌拒绝了微软对Project ZONE 90天披露或修复期限的延长请求。微软错过了谷歌的90天期限，所以谷歌公布了E的详细信息。XPLOIT减轻旁路。在一周内第二次，谷歌显示另一个未修补的Windows 10漏洞。
Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update addresses a critical flaw in the Windows VBScript engine that attackers are using to compromise Windows machines through Internet Explorer. The patch follows an alarm by researchers at Qihoo 360 Core Security The IE attack, dubbed 'Double Kill', was delivered via Office documents that open a malicious webpage in the background. In Microsoft hasn't confirmed this is the bug reported by Qihoo 360 Core Security but notes the flaw is being exploited in the wild. "In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website," Microsoft notes. "An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked 'safe for initialization' in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine."Observed attacks have started with a malicious Word document, which when opened downloads an exploit written in VBScript that's hosted on a webpage, The analysts are also confident the exploit they found is the same as the Double Kill attack Qihoo 360 Core Security reported. While the zero-day attacks are likely to be the work of state-sponsored attackers, Kaspersky Lab predicts it will become popular with cybercriminals as part of an exploit kit's arsenal for compromising Windows PCs in web-based attacks.That's because the technique allows an attacker to force IE to load and exploit the flaw on an unpatched machine even if victims have set Chrome or Firefox as the default browser."Despite a Word document being the initial attack vector, the vulnerability is actually in VBScript, not in Microsoft Word. This is the first time we've seen a URL moniker used to load an IE exploit, and we believe this technique will be used heavily by malware authors in the future. This technique allows one to load and render a web page using the IE engine, even if the default browser on a victim's machine is set to something different," the analysts said. "We expect this vulnerability to become one of the most exploited in the near future, as it won't be long until exploit kit authors start abusing it in both drive-by via browser and spear-phishing via document campaigns."The other vulnerability Microsoft has confirmed is currently being exploited is a Win32k elevation of privilege vulnerability, which is tracked as CVE-2018-8120 and rated as important."To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system," Microsoft notes. Microsoft also got around to Microsoft patched a total of 67 vulnerabilities in the May Patch Tuesday update, of which 21 are rated as critical. Microsoft is being urged to rush out a patch for a bug in Internet Explorer that's being used in attacks.Google denies multiple requests by Microsoft for an extension to Project Zero's 90-day disclose-or-fix deadline.Microsoft misses Google's 90-day deadline, so Google has published details of an exploit mitigation bypass.For the second time in a week, Google reveals another unpatched Windows 10 vulnerability.
