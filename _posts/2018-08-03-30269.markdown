A Transforming Forensics program is designed to improve how biometric services and digital forensics are used, including the development of a 24/7, faster, fingerprint identification service.Its an area in which the police in the UK have so far consistently failed.A The wider investment in IT for the police force is to be welcomed, although theres still a concerning dearth of officers trained in cyber-skills, according to several reports.Most recently thinktank Reform It recommended a new digital academy capable of graduating 1700 officers and staff each year, and an increase in the current 40 volunteers with cyber-skills to 12,000.
