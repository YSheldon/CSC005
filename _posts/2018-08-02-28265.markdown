British shipping services firm Clarksons has revealed a high profile data breach last year stemmed from a hack on a single and isolated user account.Criminal hackers stole employee information from the shipping firm before unsuccessfully attempting to blackmail it. In an update this week on its progress in dealing with the previously disclosed The breach itself ran for more than five months - between 31 May 2017 until November 4 of '17 - the update (Clarksons is in the process of notifying potentially affected individuals, some of whom have had a complete portfolio of their personal information laid bare by the breach. Judging by the types of information exposed, employees and (perhaps) contractors are among those most exposed by the breach. Clarksons has consistently refused to clarify whether or not customer data was exposed, and we still can't be sure on that point.Affected individuals are urged to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing personal account statements for suspicious activity. The scope of the data theft opens the door to all manner of ID theft scams.

It responded by notifying the police and regulators as well as launching an investigation of its own, aided by external forensics experts.

"Many cybercriminals use techniques that first target user accounts through phishing and social engineering, then move laterally to find those privileged accounts that provide them with full access to the network and sensitive data."He added: "However, in this particular instance it appears they hit the jackpot account with their first try - or they have a good passive assessment so they knew which user account to target."
