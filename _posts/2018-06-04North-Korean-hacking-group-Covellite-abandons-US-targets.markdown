链接到朝鲜的TcCayTabug似乎已经退出了对美国工业部门的攻击。目前，DRACOS公司的研究人员似乎缺乏对工业控制系统（ICS）的攻击手段，APT仍然能够收集知识产权上的情报。RTY和内部工业运作。研究人员首先记录了2017在CoviLITE上执行的针对美国目标的攻击。在许多美国电力公司发起了一项针对性的钓鱼活动，其中欺诈性电子邮件包含远程访问工具（RAT）有效载荷，用于对受害者PC进行侦察和保持持久性。然而，现在看来，美国已经越过目标LI。这是一个有趣的时刻，因为朝鲜目前有兴趣修补中美关系。美国总统特朗普和朝鲜领导人Kim Jong Un很快将在新加坡举行峰会。不尝试的据Dragos介绍，CoviLITE的基础设施和恶意软件阿森纳类似于北朝鲜拉扎鲁集团，也被称为隐形眼镜蛇。Lazarus已经连接到了一些备受瞩目的攻击，比如2014朝鲜的APT技术分析也揭示了这一点。Lite正在利用来自拉扎勒斯工具包开发的恶意软件。但是，除此之外，Dragos还不确定这两个组和他们的活动是否连接。“考虑到该集团对基础设施操作的特殊兴趣，快速提高能力，以及AGGR的历史。研究者们说，DARGOS认为这一群体是ICS产业的主要威胁。国家资助的威胁行动者来自大多数国家，而在国家的支持下，比大多数个人行动更大的资源，他们有可能造成最严重的威胁。通用电气公司。另一个与朝鲜被称为收割者的黑客团体，来自FireEye的安全研究人员说，APT主要集中在韩国，但也与日本、越南和中东的袭击有关。收割者倾向于攻击政府机构和那些政府机构。化工、军事、电子、航天、汽车、医疗、制造等部门为了收集情报。
tCyberattackers linked to North Korea have appeared to have withdrawn from attacks on the US industrial sector.Researchers from Dragos While Covellite appears to lack the means to attack industrial control systems (ICSs) at present, the APT is still able to gather intelligence on intellectual property and internal industrial operations.Researchers first recorded attacks against US targets performed by Covellite in 2017. A targeting phishing campaign was launched at a number of select US electric companies, of which fraudulent emails contained remote access tool (RAT) payloads used to conduct reconnaissance and maintain persistence on victim PCs.However, it now appears that the US has been crossed off the target list -- in what appears to be an interesting time to do so, as North Korea has a current interest in patching up its relationship with America.US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are soon to meet at a summit in Singapore.The APT is still actively targeting organizations in other countries. According to Dragos, Covellite's infrastructure and malware arsenal are similar to the North Korean Lazarus Group, also known as Hidden Cobra.Lazarus has been connected to a number of high-profile attacks, such as the 2014 North Korea was A technical analysis of the APT has also revealed that Covellite is making use of malware developed from Lazarus toolkits.Beyond this connection, however, Dragos is not certain of whether or not both groups and their campaigns are connected."Given the group's specific interest in infrastructure operations, rapidly improving capabilities, and history of aggressive targeting, Dragos considers this group a primary threat to the ICS industry," the researchers say.State-sponsored threat actors emerge from most countries, and with the backing of states and far greater resources than most individual operations, they have the potential to cause the most damage. Another hacking group of note which has been linked to North Korea Dubbed Reaper, security researchers from FireEye say the APT primarily focuses on South Korea but has also been connected to attacks against Japan, Vietnam, and the Middle East.Reaper tends to attack government agencies and those in the chemical, military, electronics, aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors in order to gather intelligence.
