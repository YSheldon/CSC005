The specs build on an earlier release the group announced in April.The xRAN Forum Fronthaul Working Group, which is chaired by Verizon, developed the new specifications.The first specification builds on that original spec This CUS spec also adds compression to increase fronthaul bandwidth and supports critical items such as synchronization and timing.The second spec provides for a management plane, or M-Plane. Katti said that this allows for the baseband unit and the radio unit to exchange information about things like configuration. He said this is necessary when using radios from different vendors because they need to know what each is capable of doing and exchange a set of parameters.The M-Plane is based on And it appears that we may soon have some resolution to the ever-confusing alphabet soup of RANs. The xRAN Forum announced in February that it was merging with the C-That merger is still happening, Katti said. Its just taking a big longer than expected.First the O-RAN Alliance had to be formed and then the governance and bylaws have to be approved. In late June Although Verizon wasnt on that list, a company spokeswoman told SDxCentral that it was committed to pursuing open RAN and was just waiting to see final governance documents for the O-RAN Alliance before joining. A Sprint spokeswoman said that it was also in the process of joining the O-RAN Alliance even though it was not included in the list of operators.Katti said that he expects all the bylaws to be approved and the paperwork to be completed by September. He also said that he will remain involved in the O-RAN Alliance as its technical chair.Look for more specification releases to occur later in the year as other working groups release new architecture interfaces.Sue is VP of Content and Editor-in-Chief at SDxCentral.
