赛门铁克在星期四披露了华尔街董事会正在调查一名前雇员提出的担忧后，面临着残酷的一天。网络安全公司没有透露员工关注的性质，不确定的股票在星期五暴跌了30%以上。赛门铁克公司表示，调查可能会推迟其年度报告的发布，其董事会已经组建了一个审计委员会，并聘请独立律师来处理此事。赛门铁克也向美国证券交易委员会报告了调查。“调查处于初期阶段，公司无法预测调查的持续时间或结果，”赛门铁克在其Q4赛门铁克中写道，现在面临着Rosen Law Firm提起的集体诉讼。代表赛门铁克股东。根据一份积极的消息，西门子公司的Q4业绩满足市场预期，这一诉讼将寻求恢复赛门铁克投资者在星期四披露后遭受的损失。该公司报告收入为12亿美元，同比增长10%。非GAAP每股收益为46美分。该公司的净亏损缩小到每股3500万美元，即每股6美分。然而，来自加利福尼亚芒廷维尤公司的主要收入来源赛门铁克的企业安全部门的销售额在第四季度下降了百分之七。首席执行官Greg Clark认为，在未来几年，网络信息保护将变得更加重要。根据赛门铁克CTO NIC SavvIDes，企业很快将无法购买非互联网连接的办公设备，因此必须建立安全策略。随着澳大利亚人很快地转移资金，银行将需要提高他们的欺诈检测能力，但赛门铁克当地的CTO称生物识别法不是这样做的。
Symantec is facing a brutal day on Wall Street after disclosing Thursday that its board is investigating concerns raised by an ex-employee. The cybersecurity firm didn't reveal the nature of the employee's concerns, and the uncertainly sent its stock plunging more than 30 percent on Friday. Symantec did say that the investigation would likely delay the release of its annual report, and that its board has assembled an audit committee and retained independent counsel to deal with the matter. Symantec has also reported the investigation to the Securities and Exchange Commission."The investigation is in its early stages and the Company cannot predict the duration or outcome of the investigation," Symantec wrote in its Q4 Symantec now faces a class action lawsuit brought by Rosen Law Firm on behalf of Symantec shareholders. The suit will seek to recover losses suffered by Symantec investors after Thursday's disclosure, according to a On a positive note, Symantec's Q4 results satisfied market estimates. The company reported revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 10 percent year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings were 46 cents a share. The company's net loss narrowed to $35 million, or 6 cents a share.However, sales from Symantec's enterprise security unit, a key revenue generator for the Mountain View, California-based company, declined seven percent in Q4. CEO Greg Clark thinks that online information protection will be even more important in the years to come.Organisations soon won't be able to purchase office equipment that isn't internet connected, according to Symantec CTO Nick Savvides, and as a result will have to establish security policies in preparation.With Australians to soon transfer money in near real-time, banks will need to up their fraud detection capabilities, but Symantec's local CTO has said biometrics isn't the way to do that.
