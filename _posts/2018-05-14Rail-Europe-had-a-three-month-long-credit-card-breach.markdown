(Image: ZDNet)If you booked train tickets for a European getaway in the past few months, you might want to check your bank statements. Rail Europe, a site used by Americans to buy train tickets in Europe, has revealed a three-month data breach of credit cards and debit cards. The announcement cameThe company said credit card numbers, expiration dates, and card verification codes were stolen -- everything needed by a fraudster to carry out unauthorized purchases. The hackers also stole name, gender, delivery and invoicing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and in some cases usernames and passwords of customers on the website. Users should change their passwords. If the same username and password set is used on any other site, they should be changed, too. Rail Europe said it "replaced and rebuilt" compromised systems from known-to-be safe code. Although the company didn't say how the hackers breached its systems to install the credit card-skimming code, the letter added that passwords were changed and certificates were renewed following the hack. It's not known how many customers are affected. California data breach law mandates that any breach affecting more than 500 state residents has to publicly list the breach notification with the state attorney general's office. A spokesperson for Rail Europe did not return an email with questions sent prior to publication, including how many customers were hit by the breach. According to the company's website, the site had over five million customers last year.Zack Whittaker can be reached securely on Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755–8849, and his PGP fingerprint for email is: 4D0E 92F2 E36A EC51 DAAE 5D97 CB8C 15FA EB6C EEA5.
