Tadobe已经发布了一个大型安全更新，它在该公司常规的每月补丁轮后一周内处理了47个漏洞。最新的补丁更新影响了Adobe AcROAT和Windows和MaOS的阅读器，以及Adobe PS图象处理软件CC的Windows和Mac OS。影响消费者版本20180.11200和更早，以及经典的2015版本2015.0630417和更早。消费者版本的AcROCAT阅读器DC版本20180.11200和更早，以及经典2017版本2017.0113779和更早，和经典2015版本2015.0630417ANAdobe AcROAT 2017版本2013.0120138和更早也受到此安全更新的影响。总共，在这些更新中解决的24个漏洞被认为是关键的。如果被利用，成功的攻击可能导致在当前用户的上下文中执行任意代码。解决的关键错误包括双自由问题、七堆溢出漏洞、13在免费bug之后的使用、类型混淆问题、不可信指针引用错误和一个OU。此外，Adobe已经修补过多的越界读取、类型混淆、安全漏洞和内存损坏问题，这可能导致信息泄露。当谈到Adobe PS图象处理软件CC时，技术巨头根据Adobe开发了TH。AUBE表示，没有任何报告被认为是在野外开发的漏洞。然而，建议用户尽快更新他们的构建。上周，Adobe的一个关键类型混淆漏洞被解决，这可以允许攻击者在Flash中执行远程代码执行。
tAdobe has released a large security update which tackles 47 vulnerabilities only a week after the firm's customary monthly patch round.The latest patch update impacts Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and MacOS, alongside Adobe Photoshop CC for Windows and macOS.Security updates for Acrobat DC impact the consumer version 2018.011.20038 and earlier, as well as Classic 2015 versions 2015.006.30417 and earlier.The consumer version of Acrobat Reader DC versions 2018.011.20038 and earlier, as well as Classic 2017 versions 2017.011.30079 and earlier, and Classic 2015 versions 2015.006.30417 and earlier are affected.Adobe Acrobat 2017 versions 2018.011.20038 and earlier are also impacted by this security update.In total, 24 vulnerabilities resolved in these updates are deemed critical. If exploited, successful attacks may result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.The resolved critical bugs include a double free problem, seven heap overflow vulnerabilities, 13 use-after-free bugs, a type confusion issue, an untrusted pointer dereference error and one out-of-bounds write security flaw.In addition, Adobe has patched a plethora of out-of-bounds read, type confusion security vulnerabilities, and memory corruption problems which could lead to information leaks.When it comes to Adobe Photoshop CC, the tech giant's According to Adobe, exploitation of the lone out-of-bounds write bug could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.Adobe says that no reports have been received which suggest these vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild. However, users are recommended to update their builds as soon as possible.Last week, Adobe's One critical type confusion vulnerability was resolved which could allow attackers to perform remote code execution in Flash.
