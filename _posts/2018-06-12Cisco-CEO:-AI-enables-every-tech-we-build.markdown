根据思科首席执行官Chuck Robbins的说法，人工智能（AI）是技术的推动者，而不是企业本身。他告诉ZDNET，AI在网络巨头的投资组合中占有重要地位。Chuck Robbins：“如果没有AI，我们就不能做我们正在做的事情。”Sp。在奥兰多Cisco Live 2018期间，ZDNET与罗宾斯合作，指出Cisco的“横跨我们的投资组合…”“如果你看我们如何处理安全和威胁的数量，有一个元素的人工智能和机器学习，我们将无法做我们正在做的[没有它]，”罗宾斯告诉ZDNET。“当我们的威胁研究人员发现了VPNFLASH攻击，有很多信息和大量的合作。MMPUT的力量会在全球范围内发现这些东西，所以在这一点上很重要，它在基于意图的网络中很重要，在我们的合作组合中很重要，它在任何地方都很重要。“有些公司会决定AI是他们的业务。“对我们来说，这是我们构建的每一项技术的推动者。”罗宾斯补充道，尽管很多公司都把AI标错了，但思科对其实际定义更为“现实”。“我们对技术究竟在做什么是现实的，我个人认为很多都是在呼唤。”今天的ED AI简直是海量的数据集，智能化算法非常快速地被处理，“他说。”称AI和机器学习“无处不在”，在整个业务中，思科的网络和安全性EVP David Goeckeler也指出了TalOS发现VPNFLASE，归因于T。他对AI说：“这是一个很好的例子，在我们威胁英特尔研究的时候，我们实际上接触到政府，我们协调如何保护人们免遭网络威胁，”他在Cisco Live上对媒体说，“因此，在CyBes上有大量的人工智能。“GECECKER把思科的AI方法归结为一个“巨大的数据集，我们利用机器和人类智能来找出威胁者在世界上的位置，我们将政策推回到基础设施”。思科特别专注于利用人工智能和机器学习技术。SS的安全组合，他说，并且已经“很长一段时间了”。“我们正在将实时遥测传输到网络的中心点，然后我们应用情报，我们有推荐引擎，当我们看到一些东西时，我们会建议修复应该是什么，所以所有这些都是L。今天我也经历了网络组合，然后你也得到了这样的交集，比如…加密的流量分析，所以基本上把网络数据加上一些安全数据，你把它们混合在一起，你用推理来找出什么是恶意软件，“Goeckeler解释说，”你不能再检查它了，因为它是加密的，但是如果我们收集足够的行为数据。我们的流量，我们可以推断非常非常高的概率和非常非常低的假阳性是什么恶意软件，所以这是一个很好的例子，我们在哪里使用非常非常先进的学习技术，与我们在网络数据和安全数据上的数据集相交。“Sp“我认为现在艾米（长）带来的是一个真正的深度分析，AI，软件专业，我认为如果你看看我们将要去的地方——我们将如何在未来从事这一投资组合——它真的将围绕引进智能创造更稳健的经验。对于那些正在使用我们的平台的人来说，“罗宾斯说。
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enabler of technology rather than being a business itself, according to Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, who told ZDNet that AI is critical in sitting behind much of the networking giant's portfolio.Chuck Robbins: "We wouldn't be able to do what we're doing without AI."Speaking with ZDNet during Cisco Live 2018 in Orlando, Robbins pointed towards Cisco's "Across our portfolio ... if you look at how we deal with security and the number of threats, there's an element of AI and machine learning, and we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing [without it]," Robbins told ZDNet."When our threat researchers found the VPNFilter attack, there was a lot of information and a lot of compute power going into discovering these things on a global basis, so it's important there, it's important in intent-based networking, it's important in our collaboration portfolio, it's important everywhere."Some companies will decide that AI is a business for them. For us, it is an enabler of every piece of technology that we build."Robbins added that while many companies are mislabelling things as AI, Cisco is more "realistic" about its actual definition."We're realists about what technology is really doing, and I personally think a lot of what is being called AI today is simply massive datasets with incredibly intelligent algorithms being processed very quickly," he argued.Calling AI and machine learning "pervasive" across the business, Cisco's EVP of Networking and Security David Goeckeler also pointed to Talos' discovery of VPNFilter, attributing this to AI."That's a very good example where with our threat intel research, we actually then reach out to governments and we coordinate activities of how to protect people from cyber threats," he told media at Cisco Live."So there's an enormous amount [of AI] that goes on across the board on cybersecurity."Goeckeler boiled down Cisco's approach to AI as being an "enormous dataset that we apply machine and human intelligence to find out where threat actors are in the world, and we push policy back into the infrastructure".Cisco is particularly focused on utilising AI and machine learning across its security portfolio, he said, and has been for "a very long time now"."We're streaming real-time telemetry to a central point in the network, and then we're applying intelligence, we have recommendation engines, when we see something we'll recommend what the fix should be, so all of that is live across the networking portfolio today as well, and then you've got the intersection of these too, like ... encrypted traffic analytics, so essentially taking networking data plus some security data and you're mixing them together and you're using inference to figure out what is malware," Goeckeler explained."You can't inspect it anymore because it's encrypted, but if we collect enough data of the behaviour of traffic, we can infer with very, very high probability and very, very low false positives what is malware, so that's a perfect example of where we're using very, very advanced learning techniques kind of intersected with the datasets we have both on the network data and the security data."Speaking on "I think right now what Amy [Chang] brings is a real deep analytics, AI, software expertise, and I think if you look at where we're going to -- how we're going to work that portfolio in the future -- it really is going to be around bringing in intelligence to create more robust experiences for those that are using our platforms," Robbins said.
