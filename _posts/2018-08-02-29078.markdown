The company has learned the hard way that there are better ways to deliver two-factor authentication than via text messagestttttttttttttttReddit has announced that a hacker has broken into some of its systems and accessed some user data, including an old database backup copy containing user credentials, email addresses, and messages. Additionally, the breach affected the usernames and associated email addresses of redditors who received email digests this past June, according to an The incident took place between June 14-18, with the company learning about it on June 19. Since then weve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again, said Slowe.So what exactly was compromised? For one thing, a database backup containing cryptographically salted and hashed password data from the period between the sites launch in 2005 and May 2007.

We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA, wrote Slowe.Security professionals have, in fact, advised against using text messages as the second factor due to their susceptibility to various threats.
