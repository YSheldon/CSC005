tttYes, the wrap-up of Wednesdays Cisco Live happenings is a little behind schedule. With most of my scheduled sessions complete, I spent more of Wednesday in the World of Solutions to check out the Cisco demonstrations and see what other exhibitors brought to share. Its a busy environment. In the new setup of the Cisco space, the Collaboration technology is integrated with other products based on the use case. It did make it a bit tricky to find things at first, but then youd be getting a demo surrounded by the other technologies that support what youre trying to do.When I did find time to take breaks and actually sit down (usually near a power source), I was always surrounded by conversations peppered with acronyms and product names. This is definitely the place to talk shop. Right now, Im sitting near conversations in at least three languages. Its beyond cool.One cool element of my job is working with the Members are under non-disclosure, so we provide them with benefits throughout the year, including pre-launch briefings, feedback sessions with product teams, and more.Cisco Live is one of the few opportunities I have to meet people in person  and its definitely one of the big benefits of attending the conference. We held two panels this week in the World of Solutions. I hosted a discussion about technical specialization vs. generalization. The Champions who joined me talked about how theyve managed their careers, when and why theyve pursued certifications, and any advice theyd provide to others. My colleague Lauren Albert hosted a panel specifically about how the program has helped members build their technical careers as well as their personal industry credibility.Our onsite events also include some behind-the-scenes tours. Tuesday morning included a behind-the-scenes tour of World of Solutions, the keynote stage, and other nerdy stuff. Admittedly, I wasnt expecting to be wowed by the keynote details. But once our hosts started digging into the technical details  the real guts behind the magic screens  it was pretty fascinating. Theres a lot happening behind the curtain to make sure things go smoothly. Another stop on the tour was a visit with the Yesterday was a busy day topped by a chaotic evening at the Customer Appreciation Event at Universal Studios. As a firm believer in work-life balance, its honestly good to see 20,000+ people go from sessions, labs, testing, and booth wandering to a ridiculously big party.We'd love to hear from you!
