For example, Chinese and Russian groups have used malware campaigns to install infected software that collects financial information and companies data.As organizations start to harden their defenses, their business relationships may be the path of least resistance to access their networks, Ray said.And while The report says Iran-based cyber espionage group Pipefish is becoming more active and advancing its tool sets. This group primarily targets energy-sector companies for surveillance and espionage objectives. Newly uncovered malware from Pipefish can execute remote commands and upload and download files from the victims system.And this doesnt just go for Iran, Ray said. If you are talking about cyber espionage activity, if your company produces something or you are in that business ecosystem, you are going to be a target. Its somebodys day job to make sure they exploit you and remain a presence on your network.Additionally, new Iran-based ransomware indicates that Iranian actors are likely to target global organizations by using ransomware as well as cryptocurrency miners for financial gain.Ray said its still too early to tell how U.S. sanctions against Iran will affect the security landscape.We are taking a wait-and-see attitude, he said. Historically Iranian threat actors, whether state or hacktivists, have really operated when they are under extreme pressure, so were not sure if it will be this phase of sanctions or potential follow-on sanctions that might spur them.Jessica is a Senior Editor, covering next-generation data centers, security, and software-defined storage at SDxCentral.
