GDPR（通用数据保护条例）于本周生效——5月25日——但据一项针对伦敦总部出口的1000名员工的调查显示，57%的员工仍然不知道他们应该做些什么来保护个人数据。EXCEL的首席执行官在一项调查中表示，只有42%的员工被提供了安全分享个人信息的方式，“比如电子邮件加密、加密文件传输或安全项目协作工具”。但是，20%的人承认使用个人应用程序或Web Server。分享公司文件的恶习。毫不奇怪，个人电子邮件导致了这一点，12%的受访者选择它作为一种快速共享文档的方式，而其他答案包括社交媒体（百分之七）、消息应用程序（百分之七）和个人云（百分之三）。这种行为将个人数据置于未经授权的访问的更高风险中，并使组织承担GDPR下数据泄露的责任。“营销部门是最坏的违规者，因为这些雇员最有可能处理个人数据（96%的市场调查者），最有可能的是。使用社交媒体帐户（70%）。根据英国的数据发送或传真给不正确的收件人；丢失或偷窃文书工作；电子邮件发送给不正确的接收者的数据；不改正数据；在发送电子邮件时不使用BCC。一种方法是提供加密的电子邮件和文件。NSFER系统，这是出口的东西之一是销售。出口交换机可以是云托管的前提。虽然公司支付订阅发送加密的消息和文件，但它是免费的，通过Web浏览器或使用Office 365的组织也可以在Edress的出口中安全地使用Office Online告诉ZDNET：“我们不提倡更换电子邮件或根本改变PEOP的方式。LLE工作-我们从过去的先例知道，这通常不会是一个成功的方法！用户只想完成他们的工作，所以安全工具必须使他们既能生产又安全的个人数据。“另一个想法是使用EXREST说，”电子邮件可以扫描对DLP政策强制强制加密消息和附件，如果用户忘记这样做，和机器。学习可以用来强调当一个不正确的接收者被添加到电子邮件中。通过这种方式，我们可以采取与员工一起工作的工具和过程来帮助他们继续做他们的工作，但也避免将个人数据置于危险之中。“但是每一个技术解决方案都必须通过教育和培训来支持。”佩珀说：“意识是遵守的一个重要组成部分：永远。处理个人数据的人应该能够识别和保护它。组织需要尽其所能为员工提供防止数据泄露的安全保障网。只有通过意识、培训和获得正确的安全技术来支持日常工作人员的工作，“英国信息专员办公室（ICO）才建立了一个条形图。
The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) comes into forces this week - on May 25 - but 57 percent of employees still don't know what they are supposed to do to protect personal data, according to a OnePoll survey of 1,000 employees undertaken for London-based Tony Pepper, Egress CEOTony Pepper, Egress's CEO, said in a The survey suggests that only 42 percent of employees had been provided with ways to share personal information safely, "such as email encryption, encrypted file transfer or secure project collaboration tools".However, 20 percent "admitted to using personal apps or web services to share company documents. Unsurprisingly, personal email led the charge on this with 12 percent of respondents choosing it as one way to quickly share documents, while other answers included social media (seven percent), messaging apps (seven percent) and personal clouds (three percent)," says Egress. "This behaviour puts personal data at higher risk of unauthorised access and makes the organisation liable for a data breach under GDPR."Marketing departments are the worst offenders because these employees are most likely to handle personal data (96 percent of marketing respondents) and most likely to use social media accounts (70 percent).According to the UK's Data posted or faxed to incorrect recipient; Loss or theft of paperwork;Data sent by email to incorrect recipient; Failure to redact data;Failure to use bcc when sending email.One approach is to provide an encrypted email and file transfer system, which is one of the things Egress is selling. Egress Switch can be cloud hosted on on-premise. While companies pay a subscription to send encrypted messages and files, it's free to recipients, via web browsers or Organisations that use Office 365 can also use Office Online securely inside Egress's Egress told ZDNet: "We're not advocating replacing email or fundamentally changing the way people work - we know from past precedent that typically that's not going to be a successful approach! Users simply want to get their jobs done, so security tools must enable them to both be productive and secure personal data."Another idea is to use Egress says that "emails can be scanned against DLP policies to force encryption of messages and attachments should users forget to do so, and machine learning can be used to highlight when an incorrect recipient has been added to an email. In this way, we can take the tools and processes staff are used to working with to help them continue doing their jobs but also avoid putting personal data at risk."But every technology solution must be backed up with education and training.Pepper says: "Awareness is a huge part of compliance: everyone who handles personal data should be able to identify and protect it. Organizations need to be doing all they can to provide staff with security safety nets that prevent data breaches. This can only be achieved through a blend of awareness, training and getting the right security technology to support the day-to-day work staff are doing."The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has created a bar chart of
