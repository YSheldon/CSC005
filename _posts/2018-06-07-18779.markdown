ÂThe biggest challenge is integrating their viewpoints.ÂAnother example of the disparity between the two ways of approaching cybersecurity is the DevOps concept of Âfail fast and fix fast.ÂÂLet me tell you: 'fail fast' doesnÂt work when youÂre fixing a connected car, or a robotic surgery,Â warned Malik.The job of security managers is complicated further by the mass of different protocols used in the IoT world to enable communication between devices and controllers.In healthcare, these challenges are compounded by the fact that medical devices in the US take 2-5 years to get certified, but if the software is upgraded they risk losing that certification. This means out-of-date and insecure platforms like Windows XP are not uncommon, warned Malik.ÂWhether weÂre talking about a power station, a hospital or your Alexa at home we need to be able to identify all vulnerable devices, ensure theyÂre properly segmented and know what activity is going on,Â concluded Malik.He added that organizations need to upgrade where possible to ensure devices are as secure as they can be, and to support modern, secure IoT architectures, as well as plan for regulatory mandates.EuropeÂs new
