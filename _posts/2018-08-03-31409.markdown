Above: Fortnite is about to explode onto Android.Tim Sweeney is quiet as CEOs go. But the head of I talked about to Sweeney in advance of the launch of the Android version of Fortnite, which now spans all major platforms on consoles, mobile, and PC. The game is a living example of how you can take an Unreal Engine game and make it run across any platform where people want to play games. I have loaded the game on an Android device using Epics Fortnite installer, and it worked.We talked about the launch of Fortnite on Android. But we also had a wide-ranging discussion about how Fortnite is helping with the development of the Unreal Engine, the importance of blockchain to the open Heres an edited transcript of our interview.Above: Tim Sweeney is the outspoken CEO of Epic Games.What were finding, really, is that the magic of the experience is that everyone can play together with all of their friends. In a single living room you can have a PlayStation player, someone on their laptop, someone on an iOS device, and someone on an Android device all playing in a single game session together. The experience of being together socially is so awesome that it kind of negates the control differences.Above: Fortnite wont be in the Google Play store.As a console developer youre targeting an installed base of, what, 80 million PlayStations, maybe half that many Xbox Ones, and the growing Switch market? The smartphone space has literally billions of devices that can play these games, depending on the performance tradeoffs. Its a huge opportunity for everybody.I think we will see, over the next two yearsa huge theme in the whole game industry will be connecting all of the platforms together and reaching the entire base of gamers. Its going to lead to huge growth. When gamers can play a game together with all of their friends, regardless of the devices they own, you have a much more compelling social experience. That applies to all multiplayer games.Above: Epic Games takes a shot at sideloading Fortnite on Android phones.Weve long seen this kind of indie versus triple-A production value split between Unity and Unreal. The move of mobile gamers to high-end games really will lead to significant growth in the adoption of those high-end games and thats good for Unreal. But both engines are strong. Theres a need for both of them to exist.The awesome thing about Fortnite is its brought a huge volume of digital commerce to Epic. We can now do that very efficiently. We can handle payment processing and customer support and download bandwidth with some great deals. Were passing the savings along with the Unreal Engine Marketplace. Weve change the royalty split from the 30/70 you see everywhere to developers getting 88 percent. We find thats a great boon for developers.The thing to understand about quality indie developers, and also asset creators, is that a large part of their income goes to costs. If theyre making a 10 percent profit from their business, going from 70 percent to 88 percent triples that margin. It makes a huge difference in their ability to compete, to hire people and to grow. I really hope theres a better trend in the industry toward economic efficiency in distribution. Mastercard or Visa will process payments for 2.5 percent or 3.5 percent per transaction. These stores taking 30 percent is just out of line. Theres a 4X profit margin or more.Above: Look out below. Here comes Fortnite on Android.A lot of the reason that services like Mastercard and Visa charge two or three percent is because they have to provide consumer protections, anti-fraud, customer service, and other systems baked in. That costs real money to operate. That has to be a balancing factor. A store is only really reliable if customers feel they can get good service from it. Thats a key consideration in all of this.
