欧盟试图增加消费者对个人数据的控制已经起到了一些有益的作用。这使它远远领先于早期的欧盟干预措施，如网站cookies的恼人通知，以及完全没有意义的你可能忽略或删除了关于GDPR的大量邮件，我不能责怪你。我实际上阅读了其中的大部分内容，以了解方法的范围和哪种方法最有效。我还搜索了我的邮箱，寻找供应商的域名，看看我是否收到过任何营销邮件，他们有多少次来，以及我是否读过其中的任何一封。在一些情况下，有超过一百封未读的电子邮件，所以我能够同时选择和删除它们。我不读大部分的电子邮件B。如果我这样做了，我就永远不会完成任何工作。我只是删除了显然没用的40%未读，并回复了半打左右的那件事。这通常会导致十几个或更多的阅读，显然没有什么用处，但显然不需要我的注意。”“新闻公告”通常属于这一类。如果我的搜索发现了一堆无用的电子邮件，我就退订了。因此，我的邮箱更纤薄，将来应该更干净。而许多公司无疑会感到惊慌，因为他们的邮件列表已经大幅缩水——实际数字受到欢迎——他们应该心存感激。选择的人必须感受到他们的信息有价值，所以他们的前景更好。邮件列表将进一步提高质量，现在人们必须积极地选择，而不是被动地，注册UPS应该永远被确认。我已经收到了几十封电子邮件给其他人，通常。因为客户给了我公司的电子邮件地址错误，公司没有检查或确认它。我已经收到机票，确认我的新车保险政策和我的苹果天才酒吧的任命，感谢G4S招聘团队，以及来自一个EX的付款收据。在亚拉巴马州的Prattville，其他的班级。不，不。不……BARCayCARD业务、Paddy Power、Pok明星、沃达丰和其他已经必须改进他们的系统的其他错误邮件已经到达。他们都是必须认真对待GDPR的公司，我敢肯定他们是这样做的。英国ICO（信息专员办公室）警告说：“令人高兴的是，IBM调查中有近60%的公司声称他们正在拥抱GDPR作为改善隐私、安全、数据管理的机会。Enter或作为新商业模式的催化剂，而不是简单的遵从问题或障碍。IBM的商业价值研究所（IBV）和牛津经济学也同样如此。公司也将GDPR视为建立信任和推动创新的机会。具体地说，一些领先的公司（不到20%）说他们“完全通过设计新产品和服务来实现安全和隐私”。这是一个非常低的数字，因为“设计中的隐私”实际上是GDPR的需求之一。完整的IBM报告，它可能会发现真正的GDPR密钥不是太多地同意邮寄列表作为设计系统（1）有助于防止错误，和（2）使公司能够收集。根据法律要求，在72小时内报告数据泄露。根据我的经验，一些大公司几乎不可能在Twitter上报告错误。例如，他们有网络表格，要求你的帐户号码时，你没有一个帐户，他们只是给你绝对毫无意义的样板回。我从未见过这样的选择：“我不是顾客。你给我发了一封错误的电子邮件。“在一个相当古老的案例中，大约一年的时间，公司停止给我送来其他人的月账单——我可以找到并找到一个人——我不得不把它升级到主任办公室去获得结果。下一次，我将借此机会测试报告安全漏洞的系统。这也可能是一个多汁的故事。
The European Union's attempt to increase consumer control of personal data has already had some useful effects. This puts it well ahead of earlier EU interventions, such as the annoying notifications of website cookies and the utterly pointless You may well have ignored or just deleted the deluge of emails about the GDPR, and I can't blame you. I actually read most of them, to get an idea of the range of approaches and which ones worked best. I also searched my mailbox for the suppliers' domain names to see if I'd received any marketing emails, how often they came, and whether I'd read any of them.In several cases there were more than a hundred unread emails, so I was able to select and delete them all at once.I don't read most emails because if I did, I'd never get any work done. I just delete the obviously useless 40 percent unread, and reply to the half-dozen or so that matter. That usually leaves a dozen or more unreads that are not obviously useless but don't obviously need my attention. "News announcements" (ie PR) quite often fall into that category.If my search turned up a bunch of useless emails, I unsubscribed. As a result, my mailbox is slimmer and should be cleaner in the future.While many companies will no doubt be alarmed that their mailing lists have shrunk dramatically - actual numbers welcome - they should be grateful. The people who have opted in must feel their messages have some value, so they're better prospects.Mailing lists will further improve in quality now people have to opt in actively, not passively, and sign-ups should always be confirmed.I've received dozens of emails intended for other people, usually because customers have given companies my email address by mistake, and companies haven't checked or confirmed it.I've received airline tickets, confirmations of my new car insurance policy and my Apple Genius Bar appointment, thanks from the G4S recruitment team, and payment receipts from an exercise class in Prattville, Alabama, amng others. Nope, nope. nope....Other erroneous emails have arrived from Barclaycard Business, Paddy Power, Pokerstars, Vodafone and others who must already have improved their systems. They're all companies that have to take the GDPR seriously, and I'm sure they do.The UK's ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) has warned that "Happily, nearly 60 percent of the companies in an IBM survey claim they are "embracing GDPR as an opportunity to improve privacy, security, data management or as catalyst for new business models, rather than simply a compliance issue or impediment".IBM's Institute for Business Value (IBV) and Oxford Economics Go thou and do likewise.Companies also see GDPR as an opportunity to build trust and drive innovation. Specifically:A few leading companies - less than 20 percent - said they were "fully implementing security and privacy by design for new products and services". That's a scarily low number because "privacy by design" is actually one of the GDPR's demands.The full IBM report, It may turn out that the real key to GDPR is not so much getting consent for mailing lists as devising systems that (1) help prevent mistakes, and (2) that enable companies to collect and report data breaches within 72 hours, as the law requires.In my experience, some large companies make it almost impossible to report mistakes without hounding them on Twitter. For example, they have webforms that demand your account number when you don't have an account, and they just send you utterly pointless boilerplate back. I have never seen an option that says: "I am not a customer. You've emailed me somenone else's data by mistake."In one rather old case, it took roughly a year to stop a company sending me someone else's monthly bills - someone I could identify and locate - and I had to escalate it to the Director's Office to get a result. Next time, I'll take the opportunity to test the system for reporting security breaches. It could be a juicy story as well.
