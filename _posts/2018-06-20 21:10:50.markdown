Hackers have come up with a never-before-seen method of installing backdoored plugins on websites running the open-source WordPress CMS, and this new technique relies on using weakly protected WordPress.com accounts and the Jetpack plugin. The technique is highly complex, and to compromise a site, a hacker must go through different steps, during which multiple things can prevent the attack from being successful. Nevertheless, attacks have been happening since May 16, according to The first step of this attack consists of hackers taking usernames and passwords from public breaches and attempting to log into WordPress.com accounts. Users who reused passwords across accounts and who did not enable two-factor authentication for their profiles are susceptible to these account take-over attempts. To be clear, WordPress.com accounts are used to manage professional blogs hosted by Automattic, and are different from both WordPress.org accounts and admin accounts for self-hosted WordPress sites that based on the open-source CMS. While the WordPress open-source CMS is managed by the WordPress community, lots of Automattic developers contribute to the open-source project and have always had a big influence and close ties to the open-source CMS. This is why, a few years back, Automattic took the analytics plugin used on WordPress.com and released it as an open-source plugin for self-hosted WordPress sites. In time, this analytics module —named One of the plugin's features is the ability to connect self-hosted WordPress sites to a WordPress.com account and use the Jetpack panel inside the WordPress.com dashboard to manage tens or thousands of self-hosted WordPress sites via the Jetpack plugin installed on each site. One of the options Jetpack provides is the ability to install plugins across different sites from the WordPress.com Jetpack dashboard. The plugin doesn't even have to be hosted or hidden on the official WordPress.org repository, and attackers can easily upload a ZIP file with the malicious code that then gets sent to each site. According to Wordfence, hackers who've been taking over WordPress.com accounts and finding linked WordPress self-hosted sites have been abusing this remote management feature to deploy backdoored plugins across previously secured sites. Experts say that attacks started on May 16, with the hackers deploying a plugin named \"pluginsamonsters,\" later switching to another plugin named \"wpsmilepack\" on May 21. The number of compromised sites is unknown, and detecting compromised sites is also difficult. \"The plugin is visible on the WordPress.com dashboard but is invisible on the target WordPress site's plugin list when active,\" the Wordfence team said. For now, hackers have been using these backdoors to redirect users to spam and tech support scams. Owners of self-hosted sites that have connected their Jetpack plugin with a WordPress.com account are encouraged to review the plugins they have deployed across self-hosted sites inside the WordPress.com dashboard. If they find suspicious plugins, they should immediately change their WordPress.com account password, enable two-factor authentication for the account, and initiate site-cleaning procedures. Wordfence said that the threat actor behind this new site hijacking technique has targeted self-hosted WordPress sites before. In February of this year, they used a technique called \"credential stuffing\" —using leaked username  password combos— in attempts to guess the credentials of admin accounts and hijacked WordPress self-hosted sites directly at the source. A hacker found a way around a previous patch in the Verge cryptocurrency source code and took advantage of the flaw to monopolize mining operations and create Verge coins (XVG) at a rapid pace. The attack took place on Tuesday, May 22 [Users who looked into the attack's aftermath believe the hacker mined over 35 million XVG coins in just a few hours for a profit of $1.65 million. The incident is eerily similar to another attack that took place Following the April attack, the Verge development team hard-forked the entire cryptocurrency's source code to patch the flaw exploited by the attacker and reverse his gains. But according to several users knowledgeable of the Verge source code, the attacker found a way around the hard-fork's patch and launched a similar attack. \"Since nothing really was done about the previous attacks (only a band-aid), the attackers now simply use two algos to fork the chain for their own use and are gaining millions,\" The Verge dev team didn't appear to recognize the attack, in the beginning, calling it a DDoS on mining pools. it appears some mining pools are under ddos attack, and we are experiencing a delay in our blocks, we are working to resolve this. — vergecurrency (@vergecurrency) Nonetheless, once it became clear what was going on, developers started working on a patch once more. It is unclear if the Verge team plans to hard-fork the cryptocurrency's source code to reverse the effects of the illegal mining like it did in April. Small update about the 51% attack today. Developer is working on a patch. But something more awsome to look forward to is we will have a complete new codebase soon!!Just like in April, no XVG coins were stolen from users' accounts, but the attack did invalidate legitimate mining operations and crashed Verge's price by 10% due to news about the attack and the creation of a large pot of new coins. An unidentified hacker has mounted several \"double spend\" attacks on the infrastructure of the Bitcoin Gold cryptocurrency and has managed to amass over $18 million worth of BTG (Bitcoin Gold) coins in the process. According to a The attacker has been deploying a large number of servers to take control of more than half of the Bitcoin Gold's network hashrate in what's known as a \"51% attack.\" This grants the attacker the ability to modify details of blockchain transactions, an ability he's been using in the last few days to perform a second attack called \"double spend,\" which as the name implies, allows him to spend the same amount of coins twice. According to the Bitcoin Gold team, this attacker has been using this combination of a 51% and double-spend attack to defraud cryptocurrency exchange services. \"The cost of mounting an ongoing attack is high. Because the cost is high, the attacker can only profit if they can quickly get something of high value from a fake deposit,\" the Bitcoin Gold team explained. \"A party like an Exchange may accept large deposits automatically, allow the user to trade into a different coin quickly, and then withdraw automatically. This is why they are targeting Exchanges.\" For the last few days, the attacker has been doing just this. He's been depositing large amounts of BTG coins at exchanges, but also sending the same funds to his own wallet. By the time exchanges realize the blockchain has been tampered with and that the transaction is invalid, the hacker has already withdrawn funds from the exchange and doubled his original funds. To counteract attacks, exchanges have been raising the threshold needed to confirm a BTG transaction in the past few days, but the hacker has continued to deploy more and more mining power to take over more than half of the Bitcoin Gold network and carry out the double-spend attack anyway. The Bitcoin Gold team says it tracked the funds stolen from exchanges to a BTG address located at More than 388,000 BTG coins have passed through this account, suggesting the hacker has made over $18 million from his attacks. To be clear, the hacker hasn't been stealing money from users, but from the exchanges. While no user has lost money, the attacks are still dangerous because they might destabilize an exchange's backup funds, or may lead to its insolvency, which in turn may prevent users from withdrawing funds. Users may not be losing money right now, but if the attacks continue, some exchanges may go bankrupt and won't be able to refund users still keeping funds with the exchange. According to one of the exchange portals who collaborated with the Bitcoin Gold team to get to the bottom of these attacks, they also believe the person/group behind this past week's events has also attempted the same attack on the original Bitcoin network in the past. Bitcoin Gold is a very popular cryptocurrency created by forking the original Bitcoin currency in November 2017, currently ranked #27 based on total market cap. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has obtained court orders and has taken control of the command and control servers of a massive botnet of over 500,000 devices, known as the VPNFilter botnet. The existence of this massive threat Cisco said the botnet appeared to be preparing for an attack on Ukraine, as the botnet's operators were working hard to infect as many devices as possible within the country. The Ukrainian Secret Service The FBI confirmed that the botnet has been created and was under the control of a famous Russian cyber-espionage unit known under different names, such as APT28, Sednit, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Grizzly Steppe, STRONTIUM, Tsar Team, and others. A This group has been behind several cyber-attacks aimed at Ukraine in the past, such as Security experts deemed the VPFilter botnet incredibly dangerous, not only because it was the work of a nation-state cyber group with nefarious reasons, but because it also included functions to intercept network traffic, search for SCADA equipment, and wipe firmware to temporarily brick devices. With such powerful capabilities, and with devices infected all over the world, US authorities stepped in to prevent further damage from this threat. Hours after the publication of the Cisco report, the FBI had obtained a With the domain firmly in its grasp, the FBI is now asking users across the world who own affected routers and NAS devices to reset their equipment. The reasoning, according to the FBI, is to make these devices reconnect to the command and control server, giving the FBI a full insight into the botnet's real size. The FBI plans to use this knowledge to create a list of vulnerable devices and notify ISPs, private and public sector partners that can deal with the infected devices. Owners of the following types of devices are vulnerable to the VPNFilter malware, and should reboot their devices, based on the FBI's advice: Microsoft said this week it plans to extend and enforce the new GDPR privacy protections to all of its customers, not just those based in EU countries. \"We will extend the rights that are at the heart of GDPR to all of our consumer customers worldwide,\" said Julie Brill, Corporate Vice President and Deputy General Counsel for Microsoft, in a statement on Monday. \"Known as Data Subject Rights, they include the right to know what data we collect about you, to correct that data, to delete it and even to take it somewhere else,\" Brill said. Users can find these new controls for managing their data in every Microsoft account dashboard, in the Microsoft has also updated its privacy statement for all users to reflect the addition of the GDPR-compatible rules. Changes to the The Windows OS maker has also launched a portal at GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and is a new user and data privacy regulation slated to come into effect in the EU tomorrow, May 25, 2018 The new regulation brings a wealth of protections to user privacy but is a nightmare for companies doing business in Europe. Some companies not willing to deal with the GDPR compliance headache, have been blocking access to their services for EU users Others are officially shutting down service for EU users altogether. Examples include Verve (online marketing), Ragnarok Online (online game), Super Monday Night Combat (online game), Unroll (email subscription service), Brent Ozar Unlimited (software supplier), Tungle (gaming software provider), and Drawbridge (cross-device identity service). Microsoft is the first tech giant that decides to take a different approach and extend GDPR to all users, instead of finding loopholes to skirt privacy protection regulations —Mozilla developers are working on an improved Tracking Protection system for the Firefox browser that will land in version 63, scheduled for release in mid-October. Tracking Protection is a feature that blocks Firefox from loading scripts from abusive trackers. It was first launched with Firefox's Private Browsing mode a few years back, But Tracking Protection is not enabled by default, and to enable the protection for normal browsing sessions, users must visit Firefox's Settings  Privacy section, and press an on/off button. Firefox Tracking Protection makes the web a joy to use again. It makes pages load super-fast. It blocks the most annoying ads. And it gives me the piece of mind that I'm not being tracked as I surf the web. Enable it today in Firefox Options/Preferences/Settings — Asa Dotzler (@asadotzler) Because it's buried deep in Firefox's settings, very few people even know it exists, let alone that they can use it outside of Private Browsing windows. To promote this feature with users, Mozilla engineers are currently working on changes to the Firefox user interface to allow anyone to enable Tracking Protection at any time from various areas of the Firefox UI. These include the drop-down security panel that shows HTTPS information or the drop-down menu that can be triggered from the top-right side of the browser. But besides the changes to the UI, Firefox devs have also worked at improving its capabilities. The Firefox browser's Settings  Privacy section now features an enhanced Tracking Protection panel that also allows users to select what anti-tracking features they can enable. While Tracking Protection has Mozilla told Bleeping Computer in Last but not least, Mozilla engineers have also simplified the process of clearing cookies in Firefox. Starting with Firefox 63, you can now clear cookies and site data for a website directly from the security panel that appears whenever a user clicks the info/lock icon in the address bar. The new button will read \"Clear Cookies and Site Data...\" and it will show up at the bottom of the security panel —the panel used to show SSL certificate information. These features are also detailed in a Firefox design doc embedded below, and anyone can preview the UI changes right now by installing and using Firefox Nightly. Earlier today, Microsoft released cumulative update KB4100403 that fixes several bugs, including Users reported these issues after updating to the latest version of Windows 10, the April 2018 Update —also known as version 1803. Owners of computers using with Intel SSD 600p Series, Intel SSD Pro 6000p Series, Toshiba XG4 Series, Toshiba XG5 Series, and Toshiba BG3 Series reported various problems. More specifically, Windows PCs using Intel SSDs would often crash and enter a UEFI screen after reboot, while users of Toshiba SSDs reported lower battery life and SSD drives becoming very hot. Many users —who still had access to a working Windows OS— were forced to downgrade back to the previous version, the Fall Creators Update, while the rest had to reinstall Windows from scratch. Microsoft became aware of the issues after a week and worked with OEM partners to halt the deployment of the April 2018 Update to any devices using the affected Intel and Toshiba SSD models [The company promised a fix for early June, but Microsoft engineers rolled one out today, via This update is available via the normal Windows Update service, or users can KB4100403 is an update only available for Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 version 1803, and besides the Intel and Toshiba SSD issues, it also patched the following bugs: As much as people enjoy their virtual assistants, sometimes they do things that are downright creepy. Such is the case for a family in Portland who discovered that Amazon Alexa recorded a conversation without permission and sent it to a random person in their contact list. According to This person, who was an employee of the husband, stated that he had received audio recordings of conversations that took place in the family's home. He was able to prove this by telling the family what they had just been talking about. When the Portland family contacted Amazon, they finally got in touch with an Amazon engineer who stated \"our engineers went through your logs, and they saw exactly what you told us, they saw exactly what you said happened, and we're sorry.\" Danielle, the family member who contacted Amazon, stated that Amazon did not provide any details as to how or why this happened.  She further wanted to return all of Amazon Alexa devices and get her money back, which Amazon has refused to do at this time. This is not the first time Alexa has started acting weird. A few months ago, Alexa started randomly laughing and freaking their owners out. Since then Amazon had BleepingComputer has contacted Amazon for a comment regarding this incident but had not heard back at the time of publication. Two years after being ousted, a criminal operation that has been inserting malware in the firmware of low-cost Android devices is still up and running, and has even expanded its reach. News of this group first surfaced At the time, experts said they found malware in the firmware of at least 26 low-cost Android smartphone and tablets models. Once ousted, Dr.Web hoped crooks would pack up and move on to another operation. But in a report released yesterday, cyber-security firm Avast says the group has never ceased operations and has continued to poison the firmware of more and more devices, growing their operation many times over. Avast published Comparing the Dr.Web and Avast reports, the malware doesn't seem to have received any updates and still operates in the same manner. It runs from the \"/system\" folder with full root rights, and its main role is to connect to a remote server, download an XML file, and then install one or more apps mentioned in this document. Because the malware ships as a firmware component, it can easily grab any app crooks tell it to and install it without any user interaction. In almost all cases, the apps the malware installs are used solely to display ads on top of other apps or the Android interface itself. Many Android users have been noticing the ads [Crooks are obviously interested in generating revenue via ads alone, and no other shady behavior has been seen. The only times the malware won't download additional apps is when the device's language is set to Chinese, when the device's public IP address is also from a Chinese IP range, and when the number of locally installed apps is below three (indicating a test/scan environment). While it appears the group may be operating out of China because it avoids infecting Chinese users —hence avoid law enforcement attention—, Avast has not yet been able to fully determine this fact. The cyber-security firm says it has had a hard time tracking when the malware is inserted in the firmware of these devices. There are too many mobile carriers and smartphone vendors affected to pin the blame on one of them. Infected devices have been found in over 90 countries, and the only common component between them is that they all use a Mediatek chipset. But MediaTek can't be blamed either, as not all devices from an affected smartphone model are infected with the malware. If one of the MediaTek firmware components would have harbored the malware, then all devices for a specific model would have been affected, not just a handful. This means the group is opportunistic and infects devices at random, as it finds a window during which it can poison their firmware. For now, Avast says it managed to take down the group's command-and-control server for a small period of time, but because the domain registrar hasn't intervened to invalidate the group's domain name, the group simply switched to another hosting provider. The The attack —codenamed The problem, as security researchers from Pen Test Partners have explained this week, is that all S0 traffic is secured by default with an encryption key of \"0000000000000000.\" An attacker that can trick a smart device into pairing with another device, a PC, or a smartphone app via the older S0 standard, can later decrypt all traffic exchanged between the two because the decryption key is widely known. The Pen Test crew say they identified three methods that can be used to trick two devices into pairing via the old S0 instead of S2, even if both support the newer security standard. The Z-Shave attack is dangerous because devices paired via an older version of Z-Wave can become a point of entry for an attacker into a larger network, or can lead to the theft of personal property. While this flaw might prove frivolous for some devices in some scenarios, it is a big issue for others —such as smart door locks, alarm systems, or any Z-Wave-capable device on the network of a large corporation. But in a \"You would need advanced equipment in proximity to the home during the short installation process,\" a Silicon Labs spokesperson said. \"When installing a new device there is a very small window of time (milliseconds) to force the S2 to S0 reversion,\" he added. \"The homeowner or professional installer will always be present during installation and is the only one who can initiate the inclusion process.\" But Pen Test Partners dispute this latter claim, saying this is not actually an inconvenience. \"When we say active attacker – we don’t mean a guy in a hoody sat in a car with a laptop,\" said Pen Test's Andrew Tierney. \"A battery-powered drop-box could be left outside the property for weeks, waiting for a pairing event to occur.\" Tierney later added on Twitter that an attacker could also deploy a denial-of-service flaw against a targeted device to force it offline and trick the owner into re-pairing it at the attacker's convenience. But Silicon Labs also claimed that the Z-Shave attack would also be hard to pull off because any time the devices would pair via S0 instead of S2 \"the smart home controller or gateway will ALWAYS notify the user if S2 is reverted to S0 during the installation process.\" Nonetheless, this claim was proven to be wrong in a demo video recorded by the Pen Test team, where researchers didn't receive any alert. The Z-Shave attack isn't actually new. Other researchers pointed out At the time, the issue was not given enough importance because the S2-to-S0 downgrade was considered an acceptable risk for the time being, as devices needed a fallback mechanism for compatibility reasons —to interconnect the old S0 devices with the newer S2 devices. But five years later, devices are still shipping with support for Z-Wave S0, despite The issue can't be ignored for longer because Z-Wave's popularity is growing among IoT device makers due to its superior range when compared to Bluetooth. The protocol is believed to have been deployed with over 2,400 smart device models and in use by over 100 million devices. More news articles and attention givet to the Z-Shave attack might be the push that some device makers need to switch to the newer and more secure version of the protocol.

This statistical data was gathered by Duo Security, a cyber-security firm, and provider of secure login/access solutions, and compiled in the company's yearly Trusted Access Report. According to Duo, more and more of enterprise users using its solutions are working from remote locations. But this wasn't a surprise for the company, being already known from other reports [What did surprise Duo experts was the sudden decline in Windows 7 usage from 2017 to 2018. Usage dropped from 65% of all Windows users in 2017 to only 27% in 2018 (see chart above). Experts believe that the WannaCry ransomware incident had an effect on enterprises abandoning Windows 7, mainly because But Duo stats also showed that not all users switching from Windows 7 migrated to Windows 10. Duo says it recorded only a 4% rise in Windows 10 usage from last year. Based on its data, Duo says a vast majority of users appear to have switched to another OS, as Windows lost market share, while macOS and iOS gained more followers. But while a 48% market share for Windows 10 among all Windows enterprise users seems a reason to celebrate at Microsoft's offices, it is not for the security community. In the real world, this means that more than half of Windows enterprise users are running an outdated version of Windows. This is a reason for concern, as these devices are prone to hacks, exploits, and malware. Nonetheless, Windows is not nearly in as bad of a shape as other operating systems. For example, the same Duo statistics revealed that the percentage of iOS, macOS, ChromeOS, and Android users running older versions of their respective operating systems are bigger than Windows'. According to Duo's numbers, 90% of all Android devices were running an out-of-date OS version, 85% of ChromeOS devices were running an out-of-date OS version, 74% of macOS users were running an out-of-date OS version, and 56% of iOS users doing the same. The Duo report also includes a similar statistic analyzing the percentage of browsers that were kept up to date. According to Duo, Firefox Mobile was by far the most out-of-date browser employed by its customers, with 95% of all Firefox Mobile users utilizing an out-of-date version. The most up-to-date browser was Internet Explorer, but this statistic is tainted because IE hasn't received any major updates for years, and users had a long period of time to update to the latest version. More statistics and charts are available in the Today Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17677 (Redstone 5) to insiders in the fast and skip ahead rings. This build introduces new features to Microsoft Edge, Narrator improvements, Kernel debugging improvements, Mobile Broadband (LTE) driver improvements, and changes to how Task Manager lists memory for suspended UWP apps. In this build Microsoft made some improvements to Microsoft Edge that include: You can now use Narrator's scan mode to select content in Microsoft Edge, Word, Outlook, Mail, and most text surfaces. We are adding support for IPv6 to KDNET. To make room for the larger headers required for IPv6, we’re decreasing the payload size of packets. As a result, we’re declaring a new version of the protocol, so that host PCs running the latest version of the debugger can be used to debug target PCs that only support IPv4. An updated SDK and WDK will be released soon with this support.  In prior versions, Task Manager would continue to show memory usage for suspended UWP apps.  With this version, Task Manager will no longer do that as Windows can reclaim memory from suspended apps as needed. The Mobile Broadband driver was updated to use the NetAdapter framework in To see the entire release notes, you can read the Security researchers have discovered a new banking trojan named BackSwap that uses never-before-seen techniques to facilitate the theft of online funds. The techniques the trojan uses have not been observed with another malware family, and they can bypass antivirus software detection and security protections put in place at the browser level. Experts believe these techniques will soon be copied by other groups and spread around to trigger a new wave of banking trojan attacks right when infections with this malware type have begun to go down. Until now, all previous banking trojans used two main tricks to steal money from victims. The first technique, now rarely used, relied on altering local DNS and Internet settings by intercepting requests for banking-related sites and redirecting the user via a proxy to a clone website of the original banking portal, where crooks would collect login credentials and act as a middleman between the user and the bank. The second technique, currently the go-to solution for all major banking trojans like Dridex, Ursnif, Zbot, Trickbot, Qbot, and others, relied on injecting malicious code inside the browser's process. This technique was efficient in the beginning, but antivirus vendors have modified their apps to scan for process injection attempts, and have become quite good at detecting these events. Browser vendors have similarly modified their software to prevent banking trojans from easily tapping into the browser's internal functions that allow trojans to meddle with a page's content. Nowadays, the process injection technique is more of a headache for banking trojan makers, as they have to review and modify their injection code after every browser update because browser vendors always change something that breaks the attackers' previous code. This constant hassle and improved AV protection are, maybe, one of the reasons why many cybercriminal groups have moved from distributing banking trojans to new types of malware such as in-browser miners, coinminers, ransomware, and others. But in a Furthermore, these techniques bypass both AV and browser-related protections because they don't tamper with the browser process at all. The first technique BackSwap deploys is a technique used for detecting when the user is accessing a banking-related website. According to ESET, BackSwap uses a native Windows mechanism named the \"message loop.\" According to BackSwap simply taps into the Windows message loop to search for URL-like patterns, such as \"https\" strings and other terms related to a bank's name. Once it detects the browser is accessing and loading a banking-related website, BackSwap uses one of two techniques to tamper with the loaded content. For both techniques, the trojan doesn't inject code inside the browser's process but merely simulates key presses. Initial versions of the BackSwap trojan used the following method to alter what users are seeing inside web pages. This entire attack takes under a second to execute, and users will have a hard time noticing that something went wrong or even distinguishing it from a regular browser freeze. But despite its simplicity, the BackSwap crew seems to have abandoned this first technique, and moved to a new one, which interacts with the browser's address bar. ESET says BackSwap supports attacks against Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer, but with little tweaks, the techniques should work against all browsers, since all modern browsers today support a developer console and the BackSwap's techniques are incredibly easy to execute, and don't necessarily rely on high-level knowledge of the Windows OS to implement, like previous banking trojan attacks. While they're bound to spread to other banking trojan families in the upcoming future, at the moment, this trojan is not a global threat. Researchers say that current versions of BackSwap come with support for altering the web portals of only five Polish banks —PKO Bank Polski, Bank Zachodni WBK S.A., mBank, ING, and Pekao. Nonetheless, ESET said it notified browser vendors about BackSwap's new techniques in the hopes they'd deploy countermeasures in upcoming browser versions, and mitigate these types of attacks before they go mainstream with other malware families. As if Ben and Jerry's, beautiful landscape, and legalized marijuana wasn't enough of an incentive, Vermont has passed legislation called the \"New Remote Worker Grant Program\" that will pay a remote worker's expenses if they move to Vermont. As remote workers can work anywhere, Vermont is hoping that this grant will entice workers to move to Vermont, which allows the State to generate greater taxes and economic growth. Approved by both the Vermont House and Senate and now waiting to be signed by the Governor, the grant will pay a remote worker up to $5,000 a year, to a lifetime total of $10,000, to cover expenses incurred from relocating to Vermont and working remotely. In order to qualify for this grant, remote workers will need to move to Vermont on or after January 1st, 2019 and apply for the grant. Existing remote workers will not be elegible to participate in this program. The expenses covered under this bill include: According to   This was a very quiet week with very few ransomware variants released and not much news at all, which we are always happy about. The biggest news has been the Contributors and those who provided new ransomware information and stories this week include: A new and active campaign for the CryptON Ransomware is currently underway where attackers are hacking into computers with Internet accessible Remote Desktop Services. Once the attackers gain access to the computer they manually execute the ransomware and encrypt your files. The Coca-Cola company announced a data breach incident this week after a former employee was found in possession of worker data on a personal hard drive. The company learned of the security breach last September after law enforcement officials contacted Coca-Cola. Investigators said that a former employee at a Coca-Cola subsidiary was found in possession of an external hard drive containing information that appeared to have been misappropriated from Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola says it worked with law enforcement in the past months to investigate the data's origin and validity, and determined that some documents contained the personal information of some of its workers. Following state laws, the company is now sending notification letters to affected employees. \"We are issuing data breach notices to about 8,000 individuals whose personal information was included in computer files that a former employee took with him when he left the company,\" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told The type of stolen and exposed data varies per employee, the spokesperson told us. \"We take information security very seriously, and we sympathize with everyone whose information may have been exposed. We regret any inconvenience or concern this may be causing them,\" the spokesperson added. \"We do not have any information to suggest that the information was used to commit identify theft.\" Coca-Cola is offering free identity monitoring for one year to affected employees through a third-party provider. The company also added it waited until now to report the breach to employees at the request of law enforcement, who were still investigating the incident. Coca-Cola is not the first major company to have its data exposed by former employees. SunTrust suffered a Plus, there are many other similar cases of disgruntled employees doing damage to their former companies on which we have reported in the past [A copy of Coca-Cola's employee notification letter is available below. Four researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Safety in Munich, Germany have published a research paper this week detailing a method of recovering data that is normally encrypted by AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), a safety mechanism designed to encrypt the data of virtual machines running on servers with AMD CPUs. The research team says their attack, which they named SEVered, is capable of recovering plaintext memory data from guest VMs running on the same server as the VM that's under attack. SEVered also doesn't require physical access or malicious code to be present on the attacked VM and can be carried out remotely by sending network requests to applications such as Apache, nginx, or OpenSSH. \"By repeatedly sending requests for the same resource to the service while re-mapping the identified memory pages, we extract all the VM’s memory in plaintext,\" researchers said in their paper, entitled \"The attack is successful because the VM stores some of its data inside the main RAM memory, and \"the page-wise encryption of main memory lacks integrity protection.\" This allows an attacker to map out the entire memory and then requests parts used by other nearby VMs, of which the attacked guest VM shouldn't be able to access, let alone in plaintext. During tests of their attack, researchers said they were able to retrieve a test server's entire 2GB memory, including data from a guest VM. Researchers achieved the best results by bombarding Apache and nginx with repeated requests, retrieving memory data at a speed of 79.4 KB/sec, while an attack on OpenSSH was slower, retrieving data at only 41.6 KB/sec. The research team also added that their SEVered attack isn't hindered by maxed out servers, being able to retrieve memory data even when the targeted VM is under a high load. The team's work was showcased last month at the 11th European Workshop on Systems Security, held in Porto, Portugal. For their test rig, researchers used an Three researchers from Columbia University have created a technique named FontCode that can be used to embed hidden messages inside font glyphs (characters). The technique takes advantage of how computers work with font glyphs, which for them, are nothing more than mathematical equations used to draw lines and curves on a screen. The FontCode technique consists of altering these equations to produce slight perturbations in one or more font characters. An external observer can scan for these perturbations and decode them into indivudual letters based on a custom algorithm. According to researchers, FontCode perturbations were designed to produce very slight alterations to current font glyphs, so they remain imperceptible to the human eye of a third-party observer. The entire idea is to hide and relay hidden messages inside normally-looking text. Researchers say the FontCode algorithm could be used to hide secret messages inside all kinds of text, not just alpha-numeric characters. For example, music notes or mathematical equations printed inside research papers. FontCode is also a medium-agnostic technique, because font perturbations could be embedded and later read from text that has been deployed in various mediums, such as images, PDF documents, Word files, screens, printed paper, and so on. The team hopes their FontCode system would be adopted in the real world. They say the system could replace barcodes and QR codes and could be used to embed additional information inside labels, where there's no additional space for a big barcode or QR code. Second, the system could also be used by whistleblowers and leakers to embed hidden messages inside benign-looking text that would not arouse suspicion during a visual inspection. Furthermore, the system could also be used as an anti-whistleblower, document watermarking, or as a copyright infringement detection system by embedding hidden messages in text or works of art that might get leaked, allowing data owners to track down the origin of the leak based on the hidden message embedded in the leaked document. For now, the system is still under development, but researchers plan to release tools for embedding hidden messages in font glyphs, and a mobile app to scan text, look for perturbations, and decode the hidden text. A demo of this app and an explanation for the FontCode technique is embedded below. More details are available in a research paper titled \"FontCode: Embedding Information in Text Documents using Glyph Perturbation\" [A new feature in Windows 10 called With Sets, when you open a program using the \"As some people may want an application started with the \"Start\" command to open in its own dedicated window, Microsoft has added the \"/newwindow\" argument to the Start command in Now if a user wants to start a new application in a dedicated window from the Windows 10 Command Prompt they can use the \"/newwindow\" argument as shown below: The above command will launch Notepad into a new window rather than in a new tab in the Command Prompt window. When testing this command, not all Sets support applications would launch properly with this argument. For example, the \"start /newwindow microsoft-edge:\" command, which I would have expected to launch Edge into a new window, just produced the \"The system cannot execute the specified program.\" error.   Oracle plans to drop support for data serialization/deserialization from the main body of the Java language, according to Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java platform group at Oracle. Serialization is the process of taking a data object and converting it into a stream of bytes (binary format), so it can be transported across a network or saved inside a database, only to be deserialized later and used in its original form. Because of its convenience, a large number of high-level programming languages support the feature but nowhere has it been more of a headache than in Java, where it's been at the heart of a constant stream of security flaws. Speaking to Reinhold says the Java team is currently working on dropping serialization support for good from the language's main body, but still provide developers with a plug-in system to support serialization operations if needed via a new framework. There's no set date or Java version when Oracle plans to drop serilization, Reinhold said. But until Oracle does this, companies and project leads that don't want a developer or a rogue module calling serialization/deserialization functions can prevent this via a \"Attacks via serialization/deserialization operations have been known for years, in a form or other, but they became everyone's problem in early 2015 when two researchers — Chris Frohoff and Gabriel Lawrence — Researchers from Their experiments showed that an attacker could upload malicious data inside popular Java apps such as WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, Jenkins, and OpenNMS.  This data would be serialized and stored in a database or in memory, but when the app would deserialize it, the app would also execute additional malicious code. The flaw rocked the Java ecosystem in 2016, as it also affected That particular Java deserialization flaw was so dangerous that While Java serialization/deserialization security issues were known for a long time, the 2015 Java Apocalypse served as a wake-up call for many companies, and the Java community as a whole, who started paying more attention to how they serialize and later deserialize data. Reinhold told InfoWorld that serialization issues could be very easily responsible for a third or even a half of all known Java flaws. His assessment is most likely correct. For example, Oracle's January 2018 security updates fixed 237 vulnerabilities, of which The issue is also very widespread across companies. A Just one Apache Struts (Java) deserialization bug from last year But while Oracle is addressing the issue in Java, serialization also affects other programming environments like A new feature proposal for the Python programming language wants to add \"transparency\" to the runtime and let security and auditing tools view when Python may be running potentially dangerous operations. In its current form, Python does not allow security tools to see what operations the runtime is performing. Unless one of those operations generates particular errors that may raise a sign of alarm, security and auditing tools are blind that an attacker may be using Python to carry out malicious operations on a system. But in Python Enhancement Proposal 551 (\"We propose two API changes to enable this: an Audit Hook and Verified Open Hook,\" Dower says. \"Both are not set by default, and both require modifications to the entry point binary to enable any functionality.\" The first of these, the Audit Hook API, will raise warning messages about certain type of Python operations. \"These operations are typically deep within the Python runtime or standard library, such as dynamic code compilation, module imports, DNS resolution, or use of certain modules such as ctypes,\" Dower says. Security or audit tools may use these messages as warning flags that something suspicious is going on, and flag or stop the Python process from continuing, before real harm is done. The second, the Verified Open Hook API, is a mechanism to let the Python runtime know what files it is permitted to execute or tamper with. Dower explains: Dower has proposed PEP-551, last year in August. Early tests suggest the performance impact of adding these two APIs is negligible, \"with the vast majority of benchmarks showing between 1.05x faster to 1.05x slower\" results. Initial plans were to have PEP-551 ship with Python 3.7, scheduled for release in mid-June 2018, but the proposal did not make the final cut, according to a Python is the second major scripting engine that is addressing the issue of \"security optics\" —the concept that programming and scripting runtimes should provide minimum transparency to aid prevention of bad behavior. The company behind Ghostery, a privacy-focused browser and an ad-blocking browser extension,  has apologized for a technical error that occurred last Friday when its staff was sending out GDPR-themed notification emails. According to numerous user reports, Ghostery sent out emails that exposed the addresses of other users. The emails were sent to batches of 500 users at the same time, and every user in each batch was able to see the email addresses of the other users. \"We at HELL YES Ghostery is off to a great start. Hey One thing you can do for Really you cannot make this up: the privacy driven Chrome extension Weird move from Ghostery realized the error on Friday, and after an investigation, explained on Saturday that the error was caused by an operator's mistake working with their new self-hosted email delivery platform for the first time.

This new campaign was set in motion last week, May 23, when the company's security experts discovered one of Cobalt's phishing emails, aimed at banks in Russia and other former Soviet states. According to a report that Group-IB plans to release tomorrow but shared with Bleeping Computer, this spear-phishing email was designed to look like a security alert sent out by fellow Russian cyber-security firm Kaspersky Lab. Victims were urged to access a link to read and answer to a complaint that Kaspersky received about an alleged criminal act supposedly committed by the victim. The spear-phishing email was an obvious ruse to lure users on a malicious site where they'd be infected with the CobInt trojan, Group-IB says. CobInt is a malware strain that was historically used only by the Cobalt group, a clear indicator that the rest of the Cobalt members weren't deterred or phased by their leader's arrests, and appear to have no plan of stopping from hacking banks any time soon. Furthermore, the group looks to have returned to attacking Russian banks, after focusing their recent efforts on other Eastern European targets. Group-IB says that previous attempts to rob Russian banks had been recorded in December 2017, more than five months ago. The group is known for silently infiltrating bank networks through individual employee accounts, and infecting other computers on the local network until they find a PC that controls financial transactions. The group, in spite of its leader's arrest, still remains a force to be reckoned with, and one of the most successful hacker groups known to date. Security experts and law enforcement officials estimate the group made more than €1 billion ($1.16 billion), with a hack average of €10 million ($11.6 million) per heist. Throughout its history, the group has stolen money through various methods, ranging from sending illegal SWIFT transactions to orchestrating ATM cash-outs. More on the group's modus operandi and their history The creators of the Taylor cryptocurrency trading app claim that an unidentified hacker has stolen around $1.35 million worth of Ether from the company's wallets. The hack allegedly took place on Tuesday, last week, \"All of our funds have been stolen,\" the dev team said. \"Not only the balance in ETH (2,578.98 ETH), but also the TAY tokens from the Team and Bounty pools. The only tokens that were not stolen are the ones from the Founders’ and Advisors' pools, because there’s a vesting contract making them inaccessible for now.\" The stolen Ether is worth $1.35 million. The Taylor team says the funds have been transferred through multiple addresses The Taylor team believes the hacker is the same person/group who stole over 17,000 Ether ($9 million) from the CypheriumChain project The funds stolen from the Taylor team come from the company's recently completed initial coin offering (ICO) round. Besides the stolen Ether, the hacker also stole some of the TAY tokens the Taylor team had created for the ICO. Taylor devs did not reveal the amount of stolen TAY tokens, meaning the hack could be even bigger. Soon after discovering the hack, the Taylor team says it also noticed an attempt to dump some of the stolen TAY tokens and exchange them for other cryptocurrencies. Developers asked the IDEX platform, where these tokens can be traded, to delist TAY tokens for the time being, in an attempt to prevent the hacker from monetizing the entirety of the stolen funds. Unfortunately, this also means legitimate TAY token owners, the users who invested in the Taylor app ICO, can't trade their tokens either.

As with any major ICO hack, rumors quickly appeared claiming the hack is Two Canadian banks put out statements on Monday announcing separate cyber-incidents affecting their customers. The two are Simplii Financial, a subsidiary of CIBC, and the Bank of Montreal —two of Canada's biggest banks. The first one to put out a The bank is currently investigating if the claim is true, but in the meantime, it says it deployed \"enhanced online fraud monitoring and online banking security measures\" to prevent abuse of customers' data. Simplii Financial promised to \"return 100% of the money lost from the affected bank account,\" in case users notice and report any fraudulent transactions. Simplii also said there's no evidence that customers of CIBC —its parent company— were affected, and the incident seems to be contained in its branch only. An hour after Simplii put out its statement, Bank of Montreal put out a similar Bank of Montreal did not reveal how many customers might have had their data compromised but said it believes to have closed the hackers' point of entry into its systems. Bank officials also added that they believe the hack originated from outside the country, albeit they did not elaborate on this claim with any other information. Statements from both banks were kept to a minimum as both institutions are still investigating the incident. Spokesperson for both banks were not available for comment. Some users are downplaying the hacks' importance due to the limited number of exposed accounts, especially when compared to the Equifax mega breach that affected over 145.5 million US users last year. Users of the NPM JavaScript package manager were greeted by a weird error yesterday evening, as their consoles and applications spewed a message of \"ERR! 418 I'm a teapot\" whenever they tried to update or install a new JavaScript/Node.js package. JavaScript developers from all over the world received the error, and not just in certain geographical regions. The bug did not affect all users, but only those behind a proxy server. In spite of this, a large number of developers were impacted because most large-scale development firms usually operate behind proxies that regulate and control internal network traffic. The reason for the bug was that some proxy servers where appending a port value to requests destined for the NPM package registry, resulting in HTTP requests that looked like The additional port 443 value confused the NPM registry's servers, which then triggered the 418 error code. The NPM team The \"Error 418 I'm a teapot\" message is not a standard server error type. This all goes back to an April Fools' prank dating to 1998, when a group of developers jokingly proposed the The In the last two decades, the 1998 prank achieved It's now quite apparent that the team behind the Node Package Manager (NPM) was also a fan of this meme. The Windows Registry Editor, otherwise known as RegEdit.exe, is an important tool for power users and IT support when it comes to fixing various Windows issues, enabling features, or diagnosing problems. Navigating to a particular key, though, could sometimes be annoying as the data in the Registry is organized in a tree format and you have to expand numerous subkeys before you got to the one you were looking for. With the release of the For example, if you want to access the \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" key to delete some autoruns, you can simply paste it into the address bar and press Enter as shown below. This address bar is also extremely helpful when assisting users remotely as you can just send them the key you wish to open and they can paste it into the address bar to easily get there. While this is not a major feature, sometimes the small things matter the most. In this particular case, an address bar in Regedit.exe is definitely a welcome addition. After it was reported that the Unfortunately, as shown by the five phone calls I received today, many people heard the reboot part, but did not read the rest of the recommendations of turning off remote administration, changing passwords, and upgrading to the latest firmware. One step that was not mentioned is the fact that the only way to truly remove VPNFilter is to reset the router to factory defaults. Due to this, people are just resetting their routers, but leaving part of the malware still present after it is rebooted. With that said, I have put together a guide on VPNFilter, what the VPNFilter is malware that targets routers and NAS devices in order to steal files, information, and examine network traffic as it flows through the device. When the malware is installed, it will consist of three different stages, with each stage performing specific functions. While Stage 1 will run again after a router is rebooted, Stage 2 and 3 will not. For this reason, the FBI has suggested that everyone reboot their router in order to disable Stage 2 and Stage 3 and to also allow the FBI to get a list of infected victims and the types of routers that are affected. According to reports from Cisco, Symantec, and the Security Service of Ukraine, the affected routers are: While the above are the currently known routers that can be infected with VPNFilter, there is no guarantee that they are the only ones. Therefore, everyone should follow the below recommendations to harden and secure their routers regardless of the make and manufacturer. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to tell if your router is infected with VPNFilter. If you are concerned, or suspect, that your router is infected with VPNFilter you should perform the suggestions below. The short answer is yes and no. Rebooting the router will unload the Stage 2 and Stage 3 components of VPNFilter, but Stage 1 will start again after the router reboots. So while the most malicious components will be disabled, VPNFilter will still be present on your device. The only real way to fully remove this infection is to reset your router back to factory defaults, which will also reboot the router. Unfortunately, this process will require you to setup your router again, add an admin password, and setup any wireless networks that are configured.  The full steps you should take to remove VPNFilter and protect your router are listed below. To completely remove VPNFilter and protect your router from being infected again, you should follow these steps: While these steps will remove the VPNFilter infection and protect you from current known threats, they are not going to protect you forever. As new exploits are discovered in current firmware, your routers will become vulnerable again. Therefore, it is always important to check for new firmware updates and install them when they come out. This is a tough one. On one hand, its always better to be safe than sorry. On the other, for some it can be very difficult to configure a router from scratch.  With that said, I A mysterious attacker is scanning the Internet for EOS blockchain nodes that are accidentally exposing private keys through an API misconfiguration. The scans started today, according to threat intelligence firm GreyNoise, and all the malicious activity appears to be originating from the IP address: 185.169.231.209. If you run an Scans appear to have started today, hours after security researchers from Chinese security firm Qihoo 360 published a report about a remote code execution flaw affecting the EOS blockchain platform, but the scans don't seem to be related to this report. Instead, the scans appear to be related to a The scans GreyNoise picked up today are related to this API endpoint, and more precisely the API endpoint located at According to the GitHub bug report, there is no authentication system to protect access to this API endpoint, which is also automatically exposed via the EOS node's public Internet-facing interface. The person behind the scans has clearly seen the GitHub bug report and is now looking for EOS nodes where this API endpoint has been turned on and left exposed online without the user's knowledge. But the situation is not as dark and grim as it sounds. According to an EOS developer answering to the bug report, this API endpoint is not a standard feature of the EOS API and is only part of the wallet_plugin. This is an API plugin meant for running tests, meaning very few node owners are likely to be exposing this API endpoint online, and generally not on production nodes. Nonetheless, careless EOS node owners who couldn't be bothered to read the API docs, should take note and disable this plugin, and use another method of retrieving private keys from their EOS blockchain node. The EOS initial coin offering (ICO), which is currently raising funds to build this infrastructure, EOS tokens, issued during the ICO, are ranked as the fifth largest cryptocurrency/token (based on total market cap) in the world, right after Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash. Earlier today, cyber-security firm Qihoo 360 revealed details [The EOS team Dan Larimer confirms the “Epic” EOS vulnerability is fixed and the reporting is FUD. Facts. Google released earlier today Chrome 67, the latest stable release of its web browser. According to changelogs released with Chrome 67, this version adds support for a Generic Sensors API, improves AR and VR experiences, and deprecates the HTTP-Based Public Key Pinning (HPKP) security feature. Users can update to the latest version via their browser's auto-update system in the \"Help  About Google Chrome\" section. As of today, the Chrome stable version number is v67.0.3396.62. Probably the biggest change in Chrome 67 is the addition of the Generic Sensors API. As the name implies, this is an API that exposes data from device sensors to public websites. The new API is based on the This API is meant primarily for mobile use, and in its current version, websites can use Chrome's Generic Sensors API to access data from a device's accelerometer, gyroscope, orientation and motion sensors. Another API that shipped with Chrome is the WebXR Device API. Developers can use this API to build virtual and augmented reality experiences on Chrome for mobile-based VR headsets like Google Daydream View and Samsung Gear VR, as well as desktop-hosted headsets like Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality Headsets. API documentation is available Last but not least, users of Chrome 67 can now flip a Chrome flag to enable and test Chrome's new UI. Details on what flag you need to edit are available in our previous coverage, Just like Google Chrome 66, this month's v67 also ships with loads of security-related changes. Similar to last month, Google has continued to roll out the Google has been using the Strict Site Isolation feature to mitigate the effects of the Meltdown and Spectre flaws. With new Meltdown and Spectre variations Chrome 67 is also the first Chrome version that supports the Last but not least, starting with v67, Google has dropped support from Chrome for the HTTP-Based Public Key Pinning (HPKP) standard. More on this change in our Users interested in finding out what else was included with Chrome 67 can check this The security-related bugs fixed in Chrome 67 are detailed in a separate blog post, A 23-year-old Canadian man who hacked into Yahoo and Gmail accounts on behalf of Russian Secret Service (FSB) agents was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. The hacker's name is Karim Baratov, a Kazakh national living in Canada. Baratov pleaded guilty last year, admitting to providing hacker-for-hire services. Among his clients were two FSB agents —Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin, 43, and Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev, 33. The two FSB agents already had access to Yahoo email accounts after hiring another hacker named Alexsey Belan, aka \"Magg,\" to break into Yahoo's network and steal authentication cookies to secretly access accounts for persons of interest. According to court documents, the two FSB agents found Baratov's hacker-for hire website and hired him to break into Yahoo accounts for which users changed passwords and they couldn't access anymore on their own. They also asked him to break into Gmail accounts. Baratov used spear-phishing techniques, posing as various service providers, to trick users into handing over passwords and gaining access to victims' accounts. Even if Baratov did not participate in the actual hack of the Yahoo network He was arrested within days by Canadian police and later accepted to be deported to the US to face charges. He Baratov was initially supposed to receive his sentencing last month, but the judge presiding over the case wanted more time to hear arguments on the sentence's length. The prosecution asked the judge to take into consideration that Baratov was also behind many other hacks for which he was not formally charged, but which he carried out through his website. The prosecution Baratov will serve his sentence in the US and will then be deported back to Canada. The young hacker apologized in court for his actions. The two FSB agents and the hacker Magg remain at large. US authorities believe all three are located in Russia, a state with which the US does not have a formal extradition treaty. \"It’s difficult to overstate the unprecedented nature of this conspiracy, in which members of a foreign intelligence service directed and empowered criminal hackers to conduct a massive cyber-attack against 500 million victim user accounts,\" said Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett in a press release today by the US DOJ. The developers behind Git and various companies providing Git repository hosting services have pushed out a fix to patch a dangerous vulnerability in the Git source code versioning software. The fix is included with Of these, CVE-2018-11235 is considered the most dangerous, as it allows a malicious actor to create a malformed Git repository containing a specially-built Git submodule. Whenever a user clones this repository, because of the way Git clients handle this malicious Git submodule may allow an attacker to execute code on users' systems. Git 2.17.1, released last night, should prevent the execution of these commands on users' computers. But patches aren't only rolled out to Git clients. A fix is also included for Git's server-side component. This server-side fix allows Git hosting services to recognize code repositories containing malicious submodules, and block users from uploading them in the first place. Git hosting services like GitHub and Microsoft (via its Visual Studio Team Services) have already deployed the patches to prevent attackers from abusing their services. \"This is actually where most of the work went,\" said Jeff King, a GitHub staff member. \"The fix itself was pretty trivial, but detection during [Git push operations] required a lot of refactoring.\" King said the work involved many projects. \"I wrote the patches for Git itself, but others worked on libgit2, JGit, and VSTS,\" he added. Edward Thomson, Program Manager for Visual Studio Team Services, has also Credit for the discovery of this vulnerability goes to Etienne Stalmans, who reported it via GitHub's bug bounty program. Users are advised to update their Git desktop and/or server clients. Honda Car India has left the personal details of over 50,000 users exposed on two public Amazon S3 buckets, according to a The two AWS buckets contained the personal details of users who downloaded and installed Honda Connect is your typical remote car management app, which allows users to interact with their Honda smart cars, but also to contract and interact with services provided by Honda Car India. As such, across time, the app had collected and stored vasts amounts of personal data about Honda India's customers and their respective cars. Bob Diachenko, the Kromtech security researcher who found the exposed S3 buckets and contacted Honda, says the servers contained the following types of user and car information: But Diachenko wasn't the first to discover Honda India's S3 buckets. Diachenko says that when he came across the exposed buckets, they already contained a file named poc.txt with the following message. This is an automated file created by a security researcher named Diachenko says the timestamp on Wiggins' file was February 28, 2018, three months and one day ago. \"Honda Car India didn't even notice that a security researcher added a note to their buckets,\" Diachenko noted. \"There is no excuse for that, it clearly illustrates that they are simply running on auto-pilot with no monitoring at all.\" The Kromtech researcher has, in the meantime, personally notified Honda Car India about their leaky S3 buckets, which are now secured. Nonetheless, the process wasn't easy. Diachenko told Bleeping Computer that it took almost two weeks to get in contact with the company and have it secure its users' data. So, finally, Today In this article I will provide a brief summary of any changes that have occurred in this new variant.  As we are always looking for weaknesses, if you are a victim of this variant and decide to pay the ransom, please While the encryption methods stay the same in this variant, there have been some slight differences. The text of the ransom note has been changed and now uses the backuppc@tuta.io, backuppc@protonmail.com, backuppc1@protonmail.com, b4ckuppc1@yandex.com, b4ckuppc2@yandex.com, and backuppc1@dr.com email addresses for a victim to contact for payment information. The next noticeable change is the extension appended to encrypted files. With this version, when a file is encrypted by the ransomware, it will modify the filename and then append the Unfortunately, at this time the ransomware cannot be decrypted for free. As this is just a cursory analysis of this new variant, if anything else is discovered, we will be sure to update this article. In order to protect yourself from ransomware, it is important that you use good computing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a reliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such as a ransomware attack. You should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat ransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics.  For example, Last, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many cases are the most important steps of all: For a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our    Keys to the Universal Music Group's IT kingdom were made available online this month due to a forgetful IT contractor, Bleeping Computer has learned. This leak of highly sensitive information took place because a third-party contractor that was managing a part of Universal's IT systems had deployed an instance of an Apache Airflow server without securing it with a password. By default, such servers are meant to be deployed inside internal networks, hidden behind firewalls. As such, to ease the work of IT engineers, the Apache Airflow team has decided to ship instances of its software without an authentication system enabled by default, reducing the amount of work and time needed to deploy a fully-working Airflow instance. However, Airflow developers understood this would cause problems, so the first sentence they wrote in the This was an obvious and clear warning for server admins deploying such systems on the Internet. But Bob Diachenko, a security researcher with Germany-based cyber-security firm Kromtech, has discovered earlier this month an Apache Airflow instance open wide on the Internet. Diachenko says the server was exposing FTP credentials, AWS configuration details (secret access key and password), SQL passwords, and internal source code for Universal Music's IT network. The researcher tracked down the leak to an IT contractor named But in an \"There is no excuse for putting security second in your development projects today,\" Diachenko says. \"There are plenty of examples now showing how this approach fails. \"For example, we've reported many MongoDB instances that leaked data because security was not the first priority in development. MongoDB made many changes to catch up. A security first approach is always the best approach when dealing with sensitive data.\" After almost a day long tease showing a humourous The only clues we have right now about Fallout 76 are from the trailer where see a vault dweller waking up at 6:34 AM on October 27th 2102 to the song \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\". This song is about West Virginia, which is most likely a clue indicating that Vault 76 is located in Virginia. The trailer continues with a TV playing a video about how its time for Vault 76 to open up and for the dwellers to explore and rebuild the world. It then pans to the remnants of a previous celebration for Reclamation Day, which is when Vaults open up to explore the world after the War. Finally, we see the Vault Dweller gearing up in a shiny Vault 76 suit and strapping on a PIP Boy, which indicates the dweller is about to leave the vault. As for Vault 76, not much is known other than brief snippets of information gleaned from other games. According to the Rumors are floating around that this will be both a single-player and multi-player game, but nothing has been confirmed from Bethesda as of yet. When the E3 gaming conference begins in two weeks, we can expect to see more information from Bethesda regarding this new game in the Fallout universe.  Automatic tank gauges (ATGs) provide information on gasoline inventory and protect groundwater from gasoline leaks. Three years ago it was revealed that ATGs at approximately 5,000 US gas stations were exposed on the Internet, without password protection.  Currently, according to a The initial research in 2015, led by HD Moore, then the chief research officer at Rapid7, was based on internet scans for devices with an open TCP port 10001. Trend Micro also conducted gas tank The use of skimmers on ATMs had been in the news for a while in 2016 when criminals began using them at the gas pump to steal Florida resident, Tracy Schlosstein had no idea someone had been hacking into gas pumps at the stations she frequents. These were Bluetooth enabled credit card skimmers. “I think that's sad because they could be over there in the next parking lot reading information, hacking it off the computer,\" Schlosstein said. At that time, there were over 300 skimmers found at gas station pumps in Florida, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Many of those were Bluetooth enabled, while others were conventional skimmers. A year later, Skimmers that send stolen card data wirelessly via GSM text messages and other mobile-based communications methods have been used in ATM skimming devices for a while now. GSM-based skimmers can transmit stolen card data wirelessly via text message which allows thieves to receive real-time transmissions of the card data anywhere in the world. There's no need to return to the scene of the crime and the data can then be turned into counterfeit physical copies of the credit cards. The states most heavily hit by pump skimming activity include Arizona, California and Florida. Attacks on ATGs in the US accounted for 44 percent of the total number of attacks. Jordan took second place for the most attacks at 17% and Brazil, the UAE, and the UK all tied for third place at 11 percent. A vulnerability exists in the Windows operating system's JScript component that can allow an attacker to execute malicious code on a user's computer. Responsible for discovering this bug is Dmitri Kaslov of Telspace Systems, who passed it along to Trend Micro's Zero-Day Initiative (ZDI), a project that intermediates the vulnerability disclosure process between independent researchers and larger companies. ZDI experts reported the issue to Microsoft back in January, but Microsoft has yet to release a patch for this vulnerability. Yesterday, ZDI published a According to this summary, the vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute malicious code on users' PCs. Because the vulnerability affects the \"The specific flaw exists within the handling of Error objects in JScript,\" ZDI experts explained. \"By performing actions in [Jscript], an attacker can cause a pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\" \"Due to the sensitivity of the bug, we don’t want to provide too many technical details until a full fix from Microsoft is available,\" Brian Gorenc, director of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, told Gorenc told us the vulnerability is not as dangerous as it sounds, as it does not allow a full system compromise. \"The flaw only allows code execution within a sandboxed environment,\" Gorenc said. \"An attacker would need additional exploits to escape the sandbox and execute their code on the target system.\" The vulnerability has received a 6.8 rating out of 10 on the CVSSv2 severity scale, which is a pretty high score, when compared to most vulnerabilities. According to Gorenc, a patch is coming. \"To the best of our knowledge, Microsoft does still intend to release a fix for this bug. However, they did not complete the fix within the timelines set out in our disclosure policy.\" ZDI usually gives companies 120 days to patch reported flaws before they go public with their advisories. According to a timeline of Microsoft's replies, the OS maker had a hard time reproducing the proof-of-concept code needed to trigger the vulnerability, losing around 75% of the 120 disclosure timeline, leaving its engineers little time to put together and test a patch in time for May's Patch Tuesday. While Microsoft did not provide an exact timeline of when it plans to roll out a patch, a spokesperson confirmed they are working on a fix. Gorenc added that ZDI was not aware of real-world attempts to exploit this flaw at the time of the disclosure. With little technical details available online, it's most likely to remain so until Microsoft releases fixes. For now, ZDI experts advise users against allowing applications that rely on the JScript component —such as Internet Explorer, wscript.exe, and others— to process untrusted JS code or files. The creators of the encrypted email service, ProtonMail, have released a free version of their ProtonVPN VPN software for macOS. Even though the free version does not contain the full features that you would come to expect from a paid VPN service it is more than capable of obfuscating IP addresses and your location. While ProtonVPN has already released Windows and Android versions, according to Dr. Andy Yen, CEO of ProtonMail, their reason for releasing the free macOS version \"is to make the world a safer place by ensuring that citizens around the world have access to an Internet free of spying and censorship. Releasing a free VPN service for macOS is another important step in that direction.” ProtonVPN offers a free service and paid subscriptions, which are full featured such as multiple devices under one account, TOR routing, higher speeds, and a full range of countries to connect from. The free version on the other hand is supported by donations and the subscriptions of the higher service tiers and has a limited feature set. For example, the free version only has servers in three countries, only allows once device at a time, and has a lower speed. At the same time, if you just wish to browse the web anonymously or circumvent censorship, then this free service should be more than adequate for your needs. Furthermore, ProtonMail  ProtonVPN are well know for their strong adherence to privacy and state that they do not log user's traffic or content and do not discriminate against devices. They also state that since they are located in Switzerland, they are protected by some of the strongest privacy laws in the world. So for those who are looking for strict privacy, anonymity, and the ability to bypass censorship, this free version is a good fit if you do not want to pay for a paid subscription.. A North Korean cyber-espionage group has exploited an ActiveX zero-day to infect South Korean targets with malware or steal data from compromised systems, local media and security researchers have reported. The perpetrators of these attacks are known as the Andariel Group. According to a report authored by South Korean cyber-security firm AhnLab, the Andariel Group is a smaller unit of the larger and more well-known Lazarus Group —North Korea's cyber-espionage apparatus, believed to be a unit of its military. The recent wave of attacks has started last month. Local media reports that Andariel hackers deployed at least nine separate ActiveX vulnerabilities for their attacks, including a new zero-day. The preferred method of action is via watering-hole attacks —hacking legitimate sites, hosting exploit code, and infecting all incoming site visitors until a high-value target is compromised. Andariel attackers usually deploy a backdoor trojan on infected hosts, which they use to search and gather information. \"The zero-day vulnerability has been found in these attacks,\" a government official from the Korea Internet  Security Agency (KISA) North Korean hackers, and particularly the Andariel Group, have a history of using ActiveX vulnerabilities, according to both Operation GoldenAxe. North Korea's cyber attack only on South Korea (using ActiveX vuln) from 2007 to 2018. A South Korean security researcher who did not want his name revealed told Acube is a desktop-based groupware application developed by Samsung's enterprise division. The application is popular with South Korean enterprises, and also supports ActiveX controls. Samsung has released an update to Acube to prevent the exploitation of this zero-day via its application. South Korea's CERT team has also issued a But until more details emerge about this mysterious ActiveX zero-day, the main point to take from these reports is that cyber-attacks carried out by North Korean hackers have continued unabated in spite of the ongoing peace talks between North and South Korean officials. Security experts expected a slowdown of North Korea's cyber-espionage activity in South Korea, similar to the slowdown of Chinese hacking ops after the US and China signed a diplomatic cybersecurity agreement in late 2015. But it has not been so. Five cyber-security vendors —Dell SecureWorks, McAfee, Symantec, FireEye, and Recorded Future— have recently shared their observations of North Korea's recent cyber-activity in a Bleeping Computer has recently covered one of Lazarus Group's most recent hacking campaigns, known as Operation GhostSecret. The US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation released a Valve developers have recently patched a severe security flaw that affected all versions of the Steam gaming client released in the past ten years. According to Tom Court, a security researcher with Context Information Security, the one who discovered the flaw, the vulnerability would have allowed an attacker to execute malicious code on any of Steam's 15 million gaming clients. In the jargon of security researchers, this is a remote code execution (RCE) flaw because exploitation was possible via network requests, without needing access to the victim's computer. Court says an attacker was only required to send malformed UDP packets to a target's Steam client, which would have triggered the bug and allowed him to run malicious code on the target's PC. The root cause of this vulnerability is a buffer overflow in one of Steam's many internal libraries —and more specifically in Steam's code that dealt with fragmented UDP datagram reassembly. The Context security researcher says exploitation of this flaw would have been trivial up until July 2017, when Valve added The added security feature made exploitation more difficult, causing only a crash of the Steam client in subsequent editions. Nevertheless, Court says that an attacker would have still been successful at exploiting this bug if he combined the original flaw with an info-leak that exposed the memory location of the Steam app. The issue is now fixed in Steam. Court reported the bug to Valve on February 20, this year, and Valve developers pushed out an initial patch for the Steam beta client within 12 hours. A final fix was released for the main Steam client After giving Steam users almost two months to update, Court has published today a Some of the recent additions to the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) web standard are so powerful that a security researcher has abused them to deanonymize visitors to a demo site and reveal their Facebook usernames, avatars, and if they liked a particular web page of Facebook. Information leaked via this attack could aid some advertisers link IP addresses or advertising profiles to real-life persons, posing a serious threat to a user's online privacy. The leak isn't specific to Facebook but affects all sites which allow their content to be embedded on other web pages via iframes. The actual vulnerability resides in the browser implementation of a CSS feature named \"The mix-blend-mode feature allows web developers to stack web components on top of each other and add effects for controlling to the way they interact. As the feature's name hints, these effects are inspired by the blend modes found in photo editing software like Photoshop, Gimp, Paint.net, and others. Example blend modes are Overlay, Darken, Lighten, Color Dodge, Multiply, Inverse, and others. The CSS3 mix-blend-mode feature supports 16 blend modes and is fully In The technique relies on luring users to a malicious site where the attacker embeds iframes to other sites. In his example, Habalov embedded iframes for one of Facebook's social widgets, but other sites are also susceptible to this issue. The attack consists of overlaying a huge stack of DIV layers with different blend modes on top of the iframe. These layers are all 1x1 pixel-sized, meaning they cover just one pixel of the iframe. Habalov says that depending on the time needed to render the entire stack of DIVs, an attacker can determine the color of that pixel shown on the user's screen. The researcher says that by gradually moving this DIV \"scan\" stack across the iframe, \"it is possible to determine the iframe’s content.\" Normally, an attacker wouldn't be able to access the data of these iframes due to anti-clickjacking and other security measures implemented in browsers and in the remote sites that allow their content to be embedded via iframes. In two demos Habalov published online (The actual attack takes about 20 seconds to leak the username, 500 milliseconds to check the status of any liked/not-liked page, and around 20 minutes to retrieve a Facebook user's avatar. The attack is easy to disguise because the iframe can easily be moved offscreen, or hidden under another element (see demo gif below, hiding the attack under a cat photo). Furthermore, keeping a user on a site for minutes is also possible by keeping him busy with an online test or a longer article. Habalov reported the bug to Google and Mozilla engineers, who fixed the issue in Chrome 63 and Firefox 60. \"The bug was addressed by Besides Habalov, another researcher named Max May independently discovered and reported this issue to Google For the past few months there have been rumors that Intel would be releasing a special edition Core i7-8086K processor to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 8086 processor. Yesterday, retailers were found online that were advertising the special processor with a speeds of 4Ghz and 5Ghz. Discovered by The 5Ghz edition was currently being priced at $489.83 on Connection.com, which is approximately $140 more than then It is not known for sure when these CPUs will be available.

Microsoft has now officially become the third most valuable company in the world as it pushes Google's parent company Alphabet into fourth place.

This is further evidenced by the reorganization of the Windows division so that resources can be allocated to more profitable divisions at Microsoft. While analysts have also been predicting the death of PCs for years, the explosion in PC gaming may spark new life into a market dominated by Windows computers. Amazon announced plans to block Australian users from ordering from its main US store (Amazon.com) and will redirect customers to its local Australian site (Amazon.com.au) instead. The move comes after the Australian government has expanded a local tax named the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to online goods shipped into the country. The GST will impose a 10% fee for all online goods imported into Australia, worth less than A$1,000 ($756). The GST is set to come into effect on July 1, this year, when Amazon also plans to enforce the geo-fencing of Australian users to their local store. While Amazon did not specifically mention this, the ban will most likely apply to other Amazon online stores (such as those for Germany, UK, Japan, etc.), as goods bought from those stores are also susceptible to the same tax. Amazon did not explain its decision to geo-fence Australian users, but fellow online store eBay has not announced a similar measure. Local Australian stores have been already applying the GST to all products, sold in stores or online. Local media reports that these store chains have heavily lobbied the government in recent years to extend the GST to online products sold by vendors situated overseas, to level the playing field. Australian users weren't happy with their government's decision, and are calling the GST as the \"Amazon tax.\" Most Australians have decried the Amazon.com.au store as being inferior to the US store, with a considerably thinner product catalog and higher prices. Criticism of the government decision has been rampant on social media, especially on Twitter. The only stuff I buy from amazon is the stuff NOT available in Australia! It doesn’t “even the playing field” if you’re not playing the same damn game! — Chris Francis (@cfrancisdraws) Not happy at all. Amazon US sells things (hardcovers) not sold in Australia. Since when are we a stiffled trade nation. This is European style response. Not free trade at all. Besides it’s going to cost more to collect the GST than the revenue gained. Canberra bunk. — Hon Gary Hardgrave (@Gary_Hardgrave) The Amazon decision to stop shipping to Australia simply shows how mad and anti-consumer the Australian government is. There is stuff (including textbooks) on the US site that simply isn't available in Australia.I just tried Amazon Australia for the first time the other night and it had almost none of the goods I was looking for and when it did they were 3 times the price. It was cheaper to buy US and pay an import fee on every single item than buy through the Australian one. So much for the global economy. Australia will be cut off from US Amazon and other overseas online retailers. Looks like the government is keen for Australians to keep paying artificially high prices, based on geography, and provide another gift to Gerry Harvey. Nerd Report: Went to the massive toilet that is Amazon Australia and searched for the Criterion Blu-ray of 'Midnight Cowboy'. What comes up?

Eventbrite-owned ticket distribution service Ticketfly has taken its website offline today after a hacker defaced its frontpage and stole a part of its customer database. The hack has taken place late yesterday night (US timezones), on May 30. At that time, users trying to purchase tickets reported that the Ticketfly website was showing a defacement message with the now infamous \"V for Vendetta\" character, the symbol of the Anonymous hacker collective. \"Ticketfly HacKeD By IsHaKdZ,\" read the website, and \"Your Security Down im Not Sorry.\" Ticketfly admins did eventually discover the hack, but before they took down the defacement message and put the site in maintenance mode, a user also noticed that many CSV files containing user data were also freely accessible via one of the site's URLs. I sent an email yesterday reporting that the ticketfly website was hacked. All of the user data and site is completely downloadable. They need to come clean on the fact that your data was comprised and still is downloadable at this very moment! Since then, that URL has been taken down, and the data is not accessible anymore. Furthermore, Ticketfly replaced the \"Following a series of recent issues with Ticketfly properties, we've determined that Ticketfly has been the target of a cyber incident,\" the message now available on \"Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken all Ticketfly systems temporarily offline as we continue to look into the issue.

Google says it added this new security mechanism as a way to prevent malicious insiders, even those with the highest level of access, from tampering with its smartphones. This new security measure is just the cherry on top of an already super-secure device that even today comes with plenty of low-level firmware protections. For example, Pixel devices use secure hardware components to store and handle the encryption keys used for encrypting the user's locally-stored data. This \"secure hardware\" also runs its own set of secure firmware that checks the validity of the user's password and also protects the device from repeated attempts to guess a password (brute-force attacks). This firmware is also protected by a code signing mechanism to prevent attackers from replacing the firmware altogether with one that bypasses password checks and just decrypts the data, no questions asked. Here's where Google's new security feature comes in handy. By requiring a phone's password when replacing or updating this firmware, Google is making sure that an attacker has to compromise both the firmware's digital signature process and the user's device password at the same time. Compromising one is hard enough, but compromising both is near impossible. It's a small update on Google's part, but one with great repercussions to device security. Sure, hacking a Pixel 2 phone was hard anyway, but not it just got many times harder.

The company's experts reached this conclusion after running Redis-based honeypot servers for the last few months. It's through these honeypot servers that Imperva had previously discovered But as time went by and as honeypot data racked up, the Imperva team has also started noticing some trends in compromises of their Redis tests servers. The most obvious pattern to spot was that attackers kept installing SSH keys on the compromised Redis server so they could access it at a later time. \"We noticed that different attackers use the same keys and/or values to carry out attacks,\" Imperva said, \"a shared key or value between multiple servers is a clear sign of a malicious botnet activity.\" Imperva experts than took the SSH keys they've collected through their honeypot and scanned all Redis servers that were left exposed online for the presence of these keys. There are Experts said they've found that over 75% of these servers were featuring an SSH key known to be associated with a malware botnet operation. One particular key from the list above stands out to this reporter. The \"crackit\" SSH key has been used for years by a known threat actor. This malicious key has been previously found on 6,338 Redis servers back A month later, the same key had been spotted by Duo Lab researchers on Furthermore, as Bleeping Computer discovered a few days after the Duo report, the same Redis servers had also been used to host and help The threat actor behind these attacks on Redis servers is also known to carry out intensive scans for open Redis servers, sometimes compromising machines within minutes after being deployed. Interesting. Deployed a redis docker test container in the cloud and in no time at all they've added crackit and a hacked ssh key. — Steven Livingstone-Pérez (@stevenlivz) The historical malicious activity associated with this SSH key alone, spanning over two years, only proves that Redis servers owners are not generally aware that Redis does not come with a secure-by-default configuration. Server admins have to consciously edit the server's configuration file to enable an authentication system, a step that many developers forget. \"Simply put – Redis should not be publicly exposed as it has no default authentication and all the data is stored in clear text,\" Imperva's  Nadav Avital says. An Internet Explorer zero-day vulnerability that came to light last month has now been incorporated in the RIG exploit kit, a web-based toolkit that malware authors use to infect a site's visitors with malware. The vulnerability in question is CVE-2018-8174. This vulnerability affects VBScript, the Visual Basic scripting engine that's included with Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office. On April 20, Security researchers from Qihoo 360, who first spotted these attacks, reported the vulnerability to Microsoft, and the company patched the bug in the Subsequent write-ups from Qihoo 360 [These write-ups were also at the base of a proof-of-concept (PoC) code released But as it happened many times in the past, the publication of these technical write-ups and PoC code have also helped malware authors, not just security researchers. For over a week now, the RIG exploit kit has been featuring a new exploit in its arsenal of weaponized vulnerabilities. First spotted by security researcher Crooks are hijacking the traffic of legitimate sites and redirecting IE users to web pages hosting the RIG exploit kit, where RIG tries to infect the victim with the Smoke Loader malware, by exploiting the CVE-2018-8174 vulnerability in IE's VBScript engine. Smoke Loader is known as a \"malware dropper,\" and upon further instructions, it will download and install another malware on users' computers, one that secretly mines for cryptocurrencies on users' PC. While in the beginning, North Korean hackers have used CVE-2018-8174 to target people of interest to the Pyongyang regime, now this former zero-day is following the pattern of all zero-days before it, and has entered the public space and exploitation chain of the RIG EK, where it's being used to target all users, not just a selected few. As Malwarebytes, Trend Micro, and Kafeine have pointed out, the addition of CVE-2018-8174 breathes some life back into the RIG EK, which previously hasn't seen any new updates for more than a year. Furthermore, recent evidence For the past week, Android users have been having fun with one of the weirdest bugs ever seen on an Android device, one that exposes their personal SMS text messages when searching for various terms. The bug has been seen occurring when users searched through Google apps like Search, Assistant, and Pixel Launcher. A user The user posted details about the weird bug on Reddit, where other users and reporters from Android-centered blogs were able to reproduce it in other Google apps, but also with other terms such as: The Google apps are normally capable of returning a user's SMS text messages, but this only happens when the user verbally instructs the app to list his SMS messages, and not when searching for any of these random terms. The bug is more \"weird\" than a security risk, as it cannot be exploited unless someone has access to the phone. But if someone has access to your phone, he'll most likely just open the SMS app instead of typing and searching for weird text. Google said it fixed the issue, and updates for the Google Search, Assistant, and Pixel Launcher apps should be available through the Play Store. The bug wasn't present on all Android smartphones, but only a few models, but all Pixel smartphones appeared to be affected. The Visa card payment system is currently down across Europe.

To that end, the recent government-wide The risk report examined federal agencies’ ability to, “identify, detect, respond, and if necessary, recover from cyber intrusions, in accordance with Executive Order 13800. The actions discussed in this report aim to improve government-wide governance processes and implement cybersecurity capabilities 'commensurate with risk and magnitude of the harm' that the compromise of a Federal information system and information would entail.” The OMB and DHS found that 71 of 96 agencies have cybersecurity programs that are either at risk or high risk. The OMB and DHS assessed the performance of 96 agencies across 76 metrics and identified the four core actions they deemed necessary to address cybersecurity risks across the Federal enterprise. Thirty-eight percent of federal cyber incident reports lacked an identified attack vector, which means that in roughly 4 out of 10 cyber incidents, it was not known who the attacker was. And, in terms of bolstering communication of cyber risks, just 59 percent of agencies reported having processes in place to communicate cyberrisks across their enterprises. The report acknowledged that, \"an agency’s ability to mitigate security vulnerabilities is a direct function of its ability to identify those vulnerabilities across the enterprise. Agency risk assessments show that this issue becomes more complex in federated agencies, where there are not standardized procedures or technology across the organization is lacking. The lack of standardization and access to common capabilities means that these agencies cannot apply a single solution to address specific cybersecurity challenges and eventually reduce their overall attack surface.\" Phishing was also addressed, as phishing attacks remain one of the most common attack vectors across both government and industry. The report notes that standardizing and consolidating email at the enterprise level is an important element of the strategy to secure users. But, some federal agencies report having several, separately managed email services inside their agencies. One agency listed 62 separately managed email services used by its staff, which would make it virtually impossible to track and inspect inbound and outbound communications across that agency. In an article in A measly 27 percent of agencies reported having the ability to detect and investigate attempts to access large volumes of data. The assessment points out that the current situation is untenable, as agencies lack both the visibility into their networks to determine the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents and the ability to minimize the impact of an incident if one is detected. With only 16 percent of agencies compliant with the government-wide goal of encrypting data at rest, one of the conclusions arrived at in the report is that there is a lack of accountability for managing risks. “Producing the \"Risk Determination Report and Action Plan\" was a requirement of the Trump administration's In fact, many have voiced concern over the decision to eliminate these roles and have warned that it will lead to a lack of unified focus against cyber threats. The report concludes by stating that, \"at a time when our reliance on technology is becoming greater and the Nation’s digital adversaries are growing more adept, we must ensure that the Federal Government can secure citizens’ information and deliver on their core missions.\" Next on the agenda, for the OMB, is taking the necessary actions to \"implement the Cybersecurity Threat Framework, standardize IT capabilities and tools, consolidate or migrate SOC operations, and drive accountability for cybersecurity risk management across the enterprise.\" And, the agency will continue to coordinate with its cross-agency partners, including DHS, NIST and GSA, to ensure that agencies are aware of expectations and available resources. The OMB will also work through the Federal CIO and CISO Councils to ensure that the federal government is moving forward towards improved cybersecurity outcomes. Apple has released security updates this week for seven products —macOS, iOS, watchOS, iTunes for Windows, tvOS, iCloud for Windows, and Safari. Out of all the vulnerabilities patched this week, two stand out, mainly because they affect the kernels of macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS alike. The vulnerabilities are CVE-2018-4241 and CVE-2018-4243, both discovered by Google security engineer Ian Beer. Neither Beer nor Apple have released expansive details about these two bugs. Both issues are buffer overflows in the kernel code that can lead to an attacker executing malicious code within the context of the kernel, giving him full access to a device. But these are all the details currently available. In fact, Apple is currently still hiding the changelog of the iOS, watchOS, and tvOS security patches in an attempt to allow users to update without giving attackers a clue to what's hiding inside. Beer is expected to release more details about the two via the Google Project Zero bug tracker next week. In the meantime, users should get patchin'! Name and information link Available for  Release date   The Security researchers from JASK and GreyNoise Intelligence All The focus on Ukrainian routers is not a surprise for researchers. The first version of the VPNFilter botnet infected over 500,000 routers and NAS devices located all over the world, but since May 8, the botnet had started looking for Ukrainian routers in particular. Furthermore, the old VPNFilter botnet also had a CC server dedicated to managing Ukrainian devices alone, separately from the main botnet. At the time of its public disclosure, security researchers believed the group behind it —the infamous APT28 Russian cyber-espionage unit— was preparing an attack on Ukraine's IT infrastructure ahead of the UEFA Champions League final, held last Saturday, May 26. Soon after Cisco Talos researchers revealed the botnet's existence, But APT28 appears to be unphased by the FBI's takedown of its original VPNFilter botnet and is now looking for new devices to compromise, and maybe this time, get to carry out its planned attack. The VPNFilter malware that infects devices is considered one of the most advanced pieces of IoT malware. The VPNFilter malware —which doesn't have anything to do with VPNs— is comprised of three types of payloads. The first-stage payload can achieve boot persistence on devices and survive reboot operations (the second IoT malware to ever achieve this), the second-stage component is akin to a remote access trojan (RAT), while the third-stage payloads are plugins for this RAT, which add extra functionality. Until now, security researchers who analyzed the VPNFilter malware say this malware strain can wipe local firmware, inspect local traffic, communicate via Tor, and search for ICS device traffic on the local network by looking for Modbus-related traffic on port 502. Most of these features are more commonly found in nation-state malware, rather than regular IoT strains. This confirms an initial assessment from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security that Russia's APT28 hacking group was behind the creation of this threat, rather than your regular script kiddie or cyber-criminal interested in launching DDoS attacks and proxying traffic for cash. A This group has been behind several cyber-attacks aimed at Ukraine in the past, such as With a new VPNFilter rising from the ashes of the old one, Ukrainian officials will need to remain vigilant in order to thwart any cyber-attacks. Ukraine has been the target of many cyber-attacks in the past years since its war with pro-Russian rebels started in 2014, such as the In Windows Insider Preview RSAT is a tool that allows administrators to manage Windows Server from a remote computer running Windows 10. For some time, Administrators have been Microsoft has listened and in the next Windows 10 feature update, called Redstone 5, RSAT can be installed an optional feature through the \"Manage Optional Features\" settings.  Once it is installed as a feature, Windows 10 will automatically reinstall it after you upgrade to another version of the operating system. This means that admins no longer need to go out and download RSAT each time they update their Windows 10 machine! In the future, to set up RSAT as an on-demand software feature, admins can go into the \"Manage optional features\" settings as shown below. To access this screen, just search for \"optional features\". To add the feature click on the \"Add a feature\" button. Microsoft will then build a catalog of available features, which may take some time, so please be patient.  You will then be presented with a list of optional features, and if you scroll down, will see a variety of RSAT tools that can be installed. These tools include ones for managing Active Directory Certificate Services, BitLocker Drive Encryption, DHCP Services, Clustering, and more. Once you install an RSAT tool using this method, it will always be reinstalled when Windows 10 is updated in the future. As this is currently a new feature in the latest Windows Insider build 17682, you will not see it in the current version of Windows. If you wish to test this feature, you can sign up as a Windows 10 version 1803 —also known as the April 2018 Update— is the fastest spreading Windows 10 update of all time, according to third-party telemetry data released last week. Over 50% of all Windows 10 PCs now run Microsoft's latest Windows 10 version, according to a report from AdDuplex, an advertising company that collected statistics from around 5,000 Windows Store apps running AdDuplex SDK. Since Microsoft has always stayed mum on Windows 10 statistics, the According to this report, it took the April 2018 Update less than a month to reach the 50% mark, compared to last year's Fall Creators Update, which needed three months to reach 50% deployment. The overall trend is that Microsoft is getting better and better at rolling out its major Windows 10 updates. Furthermore, 43% of all Windows 10 users aren't that far behind, running the Fall Creators Update, and being a click away from running the latest Windows 10 version. All in all, this means that the vast majority of Windows 10 users are running one of the last two Windows 10 updates, and should be, in theory, up-to-date with most security patches as well. But, to be honest, the AdDuplex report is also surprising because the Windows 10 April 2018 Update appears to be a success, despite beeing plagued by bad press for the past two months. The April 2018 Update was originally planned for release in the second week of the month but the official rollout was delayed until the last day of the month due to The bad press continued after the official release as well, as Windows 10 users reported Code hosting service GitLab has seen a massive traffic spike after news broke over the weekend that Microsoft has agreed to acquire GitHub, the world's largest code repository. The number one fear expressed by companies and developers is that by buying GitHub Microsoft now gets full access to the millions of private projects that companies are currently hosting through GitHub's premium service. To those that have GitLab is a dual free-commercial source code hosting service, similar to GitHub, but which also provides an open source version of the software that runs its platform. Fellow code hosting services Rumors of Microsoft looking to buy GitHub started popping up online on Friday. On Sunday, citing internal sources, Bloomberg The report said that GitHub execs opted to sell the company instead of attempting an IPO. GitHub was valued at over $2 billion in 2015, a sum that is now considerably larger. Terms of the deal were not known on Sunday. Microsoft previously paid $26.2 billion for LinkedIn in 2016, and GitHub's price tag is expected to be in the same $10 billion - $20 billion range. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO at Microsoft, the OS maker has been refocusing its efforts on strengthening its cloud-based services and having a larger presence on the open-source market. The Redmond-based company has been slowly pulling out of the mobile and desktop software market, with clear signs that its abandoning tools like While devs and companies may be panicking because Microsoft has a track record of buying products that it doesn't necessarily need and then lets them die, GitHub actually fits in Microsoft's vision for the future of its business, where cloud and development tools have a primary role. Microsoft has recently integrated several Linux distros to run on Windows 10 as virtual machines, has open-sourced its new scripting language PowerShell, has open-sourced parts of the Visual Studio code editor, and has become a behemoth on the open-source market. Microsoft is single largest contributor to open source on GitHub . According to GitHub, Microsoft has the largest open source community in the entire world with Visual Studio Code. if this is a surprise, you weren't paying attention ;) Some users started a Microsoft announced this morning that they are purchasing the source-code repository site GitHub for $7.5 billion USD in Microsoft stock.

But while mobile devs have learned to filter user input for dangerous strings, some of these devs have not learned their lesson very well. In a research paper published earlier this year, Abner Mendoza and Guofei Gu, two academics from Texas AM University, have highlighted the problem of current-day mobile apps that still include business logic (such as user input validation, user authentication, and authorization) inside the client-side component of their code, instead of its server-side section. This regretable situation leaves the users of these mobile applications vulnerable to simple HTTP request parameter injection attacks that could have been easily mitigated if an application's business logic would have been embedded inside its server-side component, where most of these operations belong. But while leaving business logic on the client-side might sound more of an app design mistake, it is actually a big security issue. For example, an attacker can analyze a mobile app (that he installed on his device) and determine the format of the web requests sent to the mobile app's servers after the user's input is validated. The attacker can then modify a few parameters of these requests in order to poison the desired action. In a research paper titled \"The two researchers created a system named WARDroid that mass-analyzes mobile apps, determines the format of their web requests, and tries to determine if these are vulnerable to these types of attacks. Researchers said they tested WARDroid on a set of 10,000 random popular apps from the Google Play Store. \"We detected problematic logic in APIs used in over 4,000 apps, including 1,743 apps that use unencrypted HTTP communication,\" researchers said. Bt since WARDroid was not a secure indicator that the app's communications template was vulnerable, the two researchers also manually analyzed 1,000 random apps from the ones flagged by their system, confirming that 962 used APIs with validation logic problems. Extrapolating this numbers to the whole Google Play Store, the two academics believe millions of apps might be vulnerable. For example, some of the apps where they found problematic API logic include a banking app, where they said they were able to modify transaction details. Similarly, they also found validation logic flaws in gift card apps that allowed them to load a test account with money to spend at various stores, and similar validation logic flaws in the communications model of apps build using the Shopify SDK. This latter flaw allowed the research team to buy products for negative prices, creating discounts inside Shopify-based mobile stores. \"You never wanna trust the client input. This is a harsh lesson that should have already been learned from the lessons on the web platform and web applications,\" Mendoza said on stage while presenting his research at the 39th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, held in San Francisco two weeks ago. \"This work highlights that this continues to be the problem —input validation and just being very cognisant of validating or sanitizing input,\" said Mendoza, also highlighting that server-side business logic should be as strict as the client-side validation logic, if not stricter. On Friday, a New York man was arrested and charged in According to the affidavit in support of the complaint: “Waldman is charged with engaging in an extensive cyberstalking campaign targeting a woman he briefly dated.  The campaign began in April 2014, shortly after Waldman and the victim ended their relationship, and continued intermittently until the date of Waldman’s arrest.  Over the course of almost four years, Waldman sent the victim hundreds of text messages, voicemail messages, and e-mail messages, and made voluminous posts on a variety of online platforms, in which he claimed, among other assertions, that she had been diagnosed with bipolar and narcissistic personality disorder, used drugs, and fabricated claims that she had been a victim of child sexual abuse.  In his online communications, Waldman also repeatedly threatened to show up at the victim’s apartment and office and threatened to injure, torture, and sexually assault her. Waldman also sent email messages to the victim’s employers, accusing her of being a ‘habitual drug user’ and claiming that he would sue her for defamation, theft, illegal trespass, violating HIPAA, and engaging in other ‘illegal behaviors.’” The updated cyberstalking law, Whoever... \"(2) with the intent to kill, injure, harass, intimidate, or place under surveillance with intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another A) places that person in reasonable fear of the death of or B) causes, attempts to cause, or would be reasonably expected to cause substantial emotional distress to a shall be punished as provided in Threats often accompany cyberstalking and 18 U.S.C. § 875(c) can be used in addition to the cyberstalking statute. It is a federal crime, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, to transmit any communication in interstate or foreign commerce containing a threat to injure the person of another.” Additionally, if the act of cyberstalking involves two or more people, all participants can be charged even if they only played a minor role in the cyberstalking. Federal prosecutors can use a While trolls are relatively harmless and will generally move on to the next target if they are ignored, cyberstalkers cross the line from annoying to illegal behavior. A cyberstalker typically becomes According to “Cyberstalking is a compulsion. It aims to humiliate, control, frighten, manipulate, embarrass, get revenge at, or otherwise harm the victim. Many cyberstalkers are obsessed, unstable, or otherwise mentally ill. Still, others are simply angry or hurt and have crossed the line into Cyberstalking escalates into more threatening behavior, sometimes even deadly, for victims in over 70 percent of cases. It can result in physical attacks, abductions and other dangerous encounters with the cyberstalker. A cyberstalker can be a former significant other, a coworker, a fan, a Over the past year and a half there has been a significant increase in the amount of cyberstalking cases investigated by the FBI. Long sentences, such as Authorities have become more savvy in how they go about nabbing cybercriminals. And, with the sharp increase in cyberstalking cases reported, federal authorities have stepped up the pace of investigating these cases. For instance, a cyberstalking suspect was arrested after The average FBI investigation takes around 18 months. If the FBI needs to coordinate with authorities in other countries, it can take even longer and the process of extradition will further extend the amount of time it will take to go to trial. Botnet operators can be as clueless about security as their victims, according to Anubhav told Bleeping Computer that he recently stumbled upon two databases of two distinct IoT botnets secured with the trivial username and password combination of root/root. What makes this incredibly ironic is that both databases belonged to botnets built with a version of Owari, a malware strain that infects IoT devices using weak or default credentials. It appears that in their haste to take over IoT devices running on weak credentials, the botnet authors themselves forgot to choose a stronger username and password combo for their command and control (CC) server's database Because of this mistake, Anubhav was able to gain access to these botnets and retrieve details about infected devices, but also about the botnet operators and even some of the clients to whom they've rented out the botnet for DDoS attacks. Both of these weakly secured botnet CC servers —located at 80.211.232.43 and 80.211.45.89— are now offline. They went offline as part of their regular modus operandi, Anubhav says. Both botnets regularly change the IP addresses of their CC servers after one week. Anubhav says the reason that miscreants regularly move CC servers is because the IPs of their attack infrastructure get added to blacklists, and they need to move the CC servers to new IPs in order to keep control of their attack infrastructure (bots, aka infected routers/IoT devices). This also means that two Owari IoT botnets are still somewhere out there using root/root as their CC server credentials. After today's revelation from Anubhav, these botnets won't last for long. Grayhat security researchers won't think twice about taking these botnets down, while other crooks will surely be looking into hijacking the weakly secured botnets from their original owners and adding it to their own. Microsoft has recently published an interesting open source project called \"PQCrypto-VPN\" that implements post-quantum cryptography (PQC) within OpenVPN. Being developed by the Post-quantum cryptography algorithms are encryption algorithms that are designed to be secure against attack by quantum computers. While quantum computers are still in their infancy, it is theorized that current encryption algorithms can be cracked using a sufficiently powerful quantum computer in a short period of time. Due to this, researchers are creating new algorithms that are designed to protect a user's privacy and sensitive data as quantum computers become more readily available. Microsoft's The project also contains instructions on how to build the PQCrypto-VPN OpenVPN implementation for both Linux and Windows. Another nice feature are instructions on how to build a Raspberry Pi 3 WiFi access point that tunnels all of its traffic over the post-quantum VPN. This allows all connected clients to automatically use these new encryption algorithms while they are connected to the Raspberry Pi. Microsoft warns, though, that this project is still experimental and that it will be a few years before it can even be determined if the algorithms are actually safe from a quantum computing attack. Therefore, it should not be used for protecting sensitive data. \"Because this project is experimental, it should not be used to protect sensitive data or communications at this time. Further cryptanalysis and research must first be done over the next few years to determine which algorithms are truly post-quantum safe.\" Quantum research has quickly become an arms race with This is especially true when it comes to cracking encrypted communications, which with quantum computers would theoretically take little time to complete. Therefore, it is important for researchers to developer post-quantum algorithms that can continue to protect data and communications even when quantum computing becomes available. Today at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2018, Apple announced a new version of the macOS operating system —version 10.14, codenamed Mojave. Mojave's main headliner is the operating system's new Dark Mode, one of the most user-requested features in recent years. Dark Mode is your basic \"night view\" desktop theme that replaces the white and bright grays —a staple of the \"Apple look\"— with black and dark gray colors. But a darker desktop won't be the only thing changing this fall when macOS officially launches. Apple also announced another new addition to macOS, a new feature called Dynamic Desktop that automatically changes the desktop wallpaper based on the time of day. Another new macOS feature is Stacks. With the click of a button macOS users will be able to group and arrange icons on a messy desktop based on their file types, such as images, documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, and more. This isn't your regular \"icon sorting\" tool either, and the feature isn't named Stacks by accident. The new Stacks feature will display icons on top of each other, in piles. When the user clicks a stack, the icons expand automatically and allow the user to interact with each one. Apple is also adding new apps for macOS as well, such as News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home. While the first three have self-explanatory names, the Home app is meant for interacting and controlling Other new features have also been added to the default macOS app Finder, but unless you're a photography nut, you won't really notice the new previewing and photo management features. Oh, and by the way, FaceTime is also getting a long-awaited \"group chat\" feature, about ten years too late. Last but not least, the Mac App Store is getting a redesign. But while the addition of a Dark Mode and Stacks in macOS are the more flashy features announced earlier today, the one that has developers all giddy is the addition of new features to the app developer framework to support iOS apps on the macOS desktop in the future. Apple said the new News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home apps were ported from iOS to the Mac desktop from their original iOS codebase, and starting with late 2019, these features should be available for the rest of iOS/Mac app developers as well. A first beta version of macOS 10.14 Mojave should be available later today via the Apple Developer Center portal for registered developers. A public beta is scheduled to start in June, for all users. You can watch the full Apple WWDC 2018 keynote below. Today at the Apple World Wide Developer Conference, Apple unveiled the next version of the mobile operating system called iOS 12. This version includes numerous improvements and features and will be available on all phones that are currently able to run iOS 11. Below we have outlined all of the new features that you can expect from the upcoming iOS 12 operating system due out in the fall. iOS 12 will be available on iPhone 5s and later, all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad 5th generation, iPad 6th generation, iPad mini 2 and later and iPod touch 6th generation.  The keynote is also at the end of this article for those who wish to see all the features demonstrated at the WWDC 2018. While apps and features are great, we want a device that responds quickly and smoothly. According to Apple, iOS 12 has been optimized to launch the Camera 70% faster, reveal the keyboard 50% faster, and to make apps launch twice as fast. iOS 12 will also dynamically increase the performance on the CPU as needed and then reduce it when it isn't in order to preserve battery life. In an announcement that must have Houseparty a little nervous, iOS 12 will have updated Facetime that allows group video calls. Even crazier, Apple has stated that up to 32 different people can take part in a group video chat at the same time.  A new feature called Shortcuts allows app to integrate themselves into Siri. Apps can now be programed to extend their functionality into Siri so that you can issue voice commands related to them. For example, the Tile app can be integrated into Siri so you can say \"I lost my keys\" and have Siri communicate with Tile to locate them. Photos has received an updated search that allows you to search for pictures by events, places, people, groups, and categories. A new \"For You\" tab has also been added that puts all your favorite pictures, memories, and shared folders in one location. For You can also recognize people in images and provide suggestions as to who you should share images with or what photos to share back with another person. Apple has teamed up with Pixar to create an Augmented Reality file format called USDZ or Universal Scene Description. This file format allows developers to include all animations, images, and sounds necessary for a Augmented Reality experience in a single file.  This file format will also work throughout iOS 12 in apps such as Safari, Mail, Messages, and the Files app. Also shown off as a new app called \"Measure\" that uses AR to measure objects. While apps like this already exist, having it built into iOS 12 is definitely a useful feature. iOS 12 also brings new expressive Animojis such as ghost, koala, tiger and T. rex and \"Memojis\", which are similar to Bitmojis. Emojis are expressive images that you can customize to look like yourself. Do Not Disturb has been updated so that it can be disabled at certain times, locations, or after certain actions. iOS 12 also gives users more options on how they can manage notifications so that they can be delivered quietly or turned off completely. Even better, notifications can now be grouped together so that you can multiple notification settings at the same time.  Screen Time is a new tool that helps you understand how much time you are spending on your device and what you are using it for.  This tool also provides reports that a parent can use to see how much time a child is spending on a particular app and allow them to schedule when the device can be used. As more and more people are realizing that their data belongs to them and not a company, Apple has included new privacy features that allow you to take back control of how your data is used. For example, Safari now includes \"Intelligent Tracking Prevention\" that blocks social media sharing and like buttons from tracking users without their permissions. Other features added to Safari include:     Two months after the Drupal project released a patch for a highly critical security flaw, there are over 115,000 Drupal sites that have failed to install the fix and are now at the mercy of cyber-criminals. This estimation comes from Troy Mursch, a US-based security researcher, who spent the last few days scanning the Internet for all sites running a version of the Drupal 7.x CMS. Mursch was able to find over 500,000 of these sites, and he says that he was able to identify 115,070 websites running an outdated Drupal 7.x CMS version, vulnerable to CVE-2018-7600, also known as CVE-2018-7600 is a security flaw that came to light in late March 2018 and was considered one of the most severe security flaws to affect the Drupal CMS since the original Drupalgeddon flaw discovered back in 2014. The vulnerability allows attackers to take over a site just by accessing a malformed URL, no authentication required. Patches were made available for Drupal 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x versions. Mursch's scan didn't look for 6.x and 8.x sites, but the 500,000 sites he managed to identify and scan are believed to be half of all the Drupal sites deployed online today. Hackers started exploiting the Drupalgeddon 2 vulnerability only two weeks after patches came out because most hackers didn't know how to attack the flaw. Exploitation attempts began soon Since then, the flaw has been used to infect servers with In a The researcher published a With 115,000 of Drupal 7.x sites still without the Drupalgeddon 2 patch, these campaigns have loads of cannon fodder at their disposal. Car parts manufacturer Continental, one of Germany's biggest companies, has banned the use of the WhatsApp and Snapchat apps on employees' work phones. The company cited the two apps' intrusive permissions as the reason for the ban, and especially their ability to access a worker's contacts list. \"In the company’s opinion, these services have deficiencies when it comes to data protection, as they access a users’ personal and potentially confidential data such as contacts, and thus the information of third parties who are not involved. In the case of these apps, access to the contact list cannot be restricted,\" a spokesperson said in a statement announcing the ban, published yesterday. Continental said it decided to enforce a ban while reviewing IT solutions used by its employees, as part of its GDPR compliance checks. \"To meet the requirements of the GDPR, each user would, in the case of WhatsApp, need to get the permission of each person in their contact list in order to share their data with these services,\" Continental said. \"The responsibility for complying with data-protection laws is therefore shifted onto the users of these apps,\" the spokesperson added. \"The company wants to protect its own employees and business partners.\" It is unclear if the German manufacturer will ban other apps with similar intrusive permissions, but Continental said it is prepared to lift the ban if WhatsApp and Snapchat change basic app settings to make the two apps GDPR compliant. Other instant messaging apps like Facebook Messenger or Skype also request access to a device's contact list, but for these apps, access to the contact list is optional, and not part of their default user experience, as it's with WhatsApp and Snapchat. Security researchers have disclosed today details about a critical vulnerability impacting open source coding libraries that handle archived files. Discovered by the researchers from Synk, the \"Zip Slip\" vulnerability is an issue in the way coders, plugins, and libraries have implemented the process of decompressing an archived file. Numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war, cpio, apk, rar, and 7z, are affected, meaning this is more of a theoretical issue, rather than a specific coding bug. According to researchers, Zip Slip is a combination between an \"arbitrary file overwrite\" and \"directory traversal\" issues that can lead to situations where an attacker can unzip files outside the normal unzip path and overwrite sensitive files, such as critical OS libraries or server configuration files. \"The two parts required to exploit this vulnerability is a malicious archive and extraction code that does not perform validation checking,\" the Synk team said today in a security advisory. Researchers said they found this flaw in April, and they have been working with the maintainers of several open-source libraries that were vulnerable to this attack. The Synk team has published a While libraries written in several programming languages are known to be affected —such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, .NET, Go, and Groovy—, the issue mainly affects the Java ecosystem because there's no official library recommended for handling archived files. Instead, developers have created and used an assortment of libraries for this purpose, most of which are vulnerable to Zip Slip. Furthermore, the issue is so widespread that even some of the To help developers understand the Zip Slip attack and aid them in detecting if their apps are vulnerable, the Synk team has published a Researchers have also published At the Computex Tapei conference, Intel has officially announced the upcoming availability of their 8th Generation Intel® Core™ i7-8086K Limited Edition CPU. This processor is being released to to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Intel's 8086 processor and Intel's first consumer desktop processor that runs out-of-the-box at speeds up to 5Ghz.  The i7-8086K has a base speed of 4Ghz and can go up to 5Ghz in Turbo Mode. Turbo Mode is an Intel technology that boosts the CPU speed when the workload requires it and environmental conditions such as temperature and power consumption are in the proper ranges. The i7-8086K also features Intel's first 6-core, 12-thread processor with integrated graphics. For overclockers, the CPU is unlocked, which means that it can be overclocked to even greater stable speeds depending on the cooling provided to the CPU and power settings. This CPU will be available starting on June 8th 2018 and will have limited availability, so anyone who wants one should check their favorite stores over the next few days. While Intel has not officially announced the price, previous As part of the anniversary celebration, Intel is conducting a sweepstakes where they are giving away 8,086 8th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-8086k Limited Edition processors. This sweepstakes starts on June 7th 2018 5:00 pm PST and can be Family genealogy and DNA testing site MyHeritage announced on Monday a security breach during which an attacker made off with account details for over 92 million MyHeritage users. In a The incident came to light after a security researcher found an archive on a third-party server containing the personal details of 92,283,889 MyHeritage users. The archive contained only emails and hashed passwords, but not payment card details or DNA test results. MyHeritage says it uses third-party payment processors for financial operations, meaning payment data was never stored on its systems, while DNA test results were saved on separate servers from the one that managed user accounts. Based on the creation dates of some accounts, the breach appears to have taken place on October 26, 2017. It is unclear if the breach is the result of a hacker attack or because of a malicious employee selling the company's data. MyHeritage says that user accounts are safe, as the passwords were hashed using a per-user unique cryptographic key. \"MyHeritage does not store user passwords, but rather a one-way hash of each password, in which the hash key differs for each customer,\" the company said. \"Since Oct 26, 2017 (the date of the breach) and the present we have not seen any activity indicating that any MyHeritage accounts had been compromised.\" The company announced the breach in the same day it found out about it because of the EU's GDPR legislation that forces companies activating in the EU to disclose any security incident within three days of finding out. MyHeritage says it has now reached out to a cyber-security firm to help it investigate the breach severity and what other systems the hacker might have accessed. The company also promised to roll out a two-factor authentication (2FA) feature for user accounts, so even if the hacker manages to decrypt the hashed passwords, these would be useless without the second-step verification code. It goes without saying that MyHeritage users should change their passwords as soon as possible. The MyHeritage incident marks the biggest data breach of the year, and the biggest leak since last year's Equifax hack. The Mozilla team has rolled out a new Test Pilot experiment that lets users customize some of their browser's user interface element colors. These new customization controls are only available if users install the This would then install a second add-on that would grant users access to a dashboard where they can customize the browser's UI colors. Not all the browser can be customized, but only the top section containing the menu bar, tab bar, address bar, and bookmarks bar. The Firefox settings section will remain as it was before. For users getting started with the new \"Color\" dashboard, there are 24 pre-built browser themes to get them started. The Color experiment comes just as Mozilla has But Personas only allow the user to change the top section's background with a custom image. The Color experiment takes Personas to a new level by allowing users to control background colors, highlights, and text colors as well. Either way, Color is nowhere near the customizability of the old Firefox \"full themes,\" which also allowed theme developers to adjust tab size, tab width, tab and toolbar positions, and many other options. Besides the Color experiment, Mozilla also launched a second experiment. This second Test Pilot feature —named \"The Side View feature takes advantage of a native Firefox feature called the sidebar panel. Normally, Firefox uses this sidebar to show bookmarks, browser history, or synced tabs across devices, but unbeknownst to most, the sidebar panel can also be used to view web pages. Some clever Firefox users were already using this feature to view pages side by side for a long long time. The Side View Test Pilot experiment makes sending pages to the sidebar panel much easier, with the click of a menu option or toolbar button. At the Computex Tapei conference, Asus announced a new Zenbook Pro laptop that replaces the touchpad with a interactive touch screen called a ScreenPad. ScreenPads are high resolution displays that not only acts as a touchpad, but also allow you to launch applications and display information directly on the display. While the The ScreenPad has a 5.5” FHD (1920 x 1080) Super IPS+ display that is glass covered for fingerprint and smudge resistance. It also includes a precision touchpad that allows for four-finger gestures. The best part, though, is its ability to launch numerous apps directly on the ScreenPad. These apps include ScreenPad for Office, ScreenPad Launcher, ScreenPad Music Player, ScreenPad Calculator, ScreenPad Calendar, and ScreenPad NumKey. These apps are all launched directly onto the ScreenPad and allow you to have quick access to tools such as a calculator, your calendar, music, or mail. These apps also can be used to complement other applications installed on the computer. For example, ScreenPad for Office provides quick access to various formatting tools directly from the touchscreen.  This way you can use the ScreenPad to quickly highlight some text and then tap on the Bold button to bold it. In addition to apps, you can create your own shortcuts to launch applications on the computer or control music playback.  The video below has a great demo of the features of the Zenbook Pro and the ScreenPad. The Zenbook Pro will go on sale starting in July and start at $2,299 for the 15\" model.  Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed two lawsuits on Monday against Facebook and Google on the grounds of breaking local campaign finance laws. AG Ferguson claims the two Silicon Valley tech firms failed to abide state campaign finance laws which dictate that advertisers reveal details about those who purchased political advertising during election seasons. According to state laws, advertisers are required to collect information on the sources and payments of political advertising. This data must be made available to anyone for public inspection. AG Ferguson says that Facebook and Google have failed to respond to queries about political ads that ran inside the state. Both Google and Facebook should have collected and later provided details such as: Ferguson said the state filed the lawsuit after his Office received complaints from state citizens in April about Facebook and Google not honoring these data requests. The Attorney General's Office believes neither company bothered with collecting this data. \"Washington’s political advertising disclosure laws apply to everyone, whether you are a small-town newspaper or a large corporation,\" Ferguson said. \"Washingtonians have a right to know who’s paying for the political advertising they see.\" Facebook and Google did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. Copies of the two legal complaints at the base of both lawsuits are available Microsoft has announced a monster single-instance Azure VM that supports up to 12 Terabytes of memory being made available in the near future. This is the largest memory configuration for a single VM in the public cloud and is part of their M-Series of virtual machines. These new VM sizes will be based on Intel Xeon Scalable (Skylake) processors, which are optimized to be used in cloud infrastructures. The 12TB virtual machine will most likely utilize the Intel XEON Platinum processor, which supports up to 28 CPU cores, 8+ socket configurations, and up to 12TB of memory.  Also These new large memory configurations are a continuing investment by Microsoft to offer memory intensive SAP HANA customers more options in order to increase performance and to capture their business. With the revenue generated by Microsoft's Azure cloud services The Atlanta Police Department has lost years worth of police car dashcam videos following the March ransomware attack that affected most of the city's IT infrastructure. In an exclusive interview with the Chief Shields said footage from body-worn cameras was not compromised in the cyber-attack that crippled Atlanta city IT systems for almost two months, but only videos recorded by police car dashcams. The normal train of thought is that the loss of the dashcam data could affect some DUI investigations, but Chief Shields downplayed the importance of the dashcam footage in pursuing DUI charges. \"I'm not overly concerned. I'm really not,\" she told reporters. \"The dashcam doesn’t make the cases for us. There’s got to be the corroborating testimony of the officer. There will be other pieces of evidence. It’s not something that makes or breaks cases for us.\" Nonetheless, cases could still be affected if the defendant's lawyer finds questionable details in the officer testimony that under normal circumstances would have been corroborated by audio and video evidence. Cases investigating violent acts or road crashes are also up in the air. Nevertheless, the Atlanta Police Department can count itself lucky. Chief Shields said that in the immediate aftermath of the ransomware incident, the department had limited access to investigative files that were stored on its server. The files and access to the server were later restored, and the evidence is now safe. The Atlanta Police Department was lucky when compared to the police departments in The now infamous The incident blocked access to many city bills payment sites, its judiciary and public records system, and impacted in various ways almost all city-run departments, except the 911 emergency system. On May 18, almost two months after the incident, city officials announced they've managed to restore all affected systems. Initially, it was reported that the city of Atlanta paid over US cyber-security firm CrowdStrike announced yesterday a new warranty program for its customers, offering to cover up to $1 million in expenses if a customer protected by its top-tier endpoint protection solution (aka fancy word for antivirus program) suffers a security breach. The CrowdStrike \"Based on the number of licenses a customer purchases, the breach warranty can cover costs up to $1 million for the duration of the Falcom EPP Complete subscription —which can be acquired for one year periods. CrowdStrike says customers can use the warranty to cover certain breach response fees and expenses incurred by the customer following the breach, such as legal consultation, forensic services, notification expenses, identity theft and credit monitoring, public relations and cyber extortion payments. The warranty is offered on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, and CrowdStrike doesn't plan to allow customers to negotiate its terms and coverage. The warranty will only cover security breaches during its duration, and pre-existing security incidents are not eligible. \"Other industries have long offered product warranties to assure customers that the products they purchase will function as advertised,\" CrowdStrike said yesterday in a canned presser. \"This has not been the case in cybersecurity, where customers generally have little recourse when security products fail to protect them.\" The company claims it's the first to offer such a data breach warranty protection to clients. This may be true for \"data breaches,\" but not true for other types of security incidents. A security breach at one of the world's largest human resources providers, Australian company PageUp, has resulted in tens of companies that were using their services notifying employees and applicants today that their personal data might have been stolen last month. In a \"On May 28, 2018, our investigations revealed that we have some indicators that client data may have been compromised,\" PageUp said today. PageUp is an Australian company that provides HR, careers, and recruitment services across the world. Customers who sign up with PageUp can embed a custom IT solution on their public \"career sites\" and intranets that helps them publish job openings, receive applicant CVs, and select the appropriate candidates. Data submitted by job applicants is stored on PageUp's cloud infrastructure, and HR staffers at each company can access it via customized dashboards. All in all, PageUp's solution is quite popular with HR departments across the world. The company touts hundreds of customers, ranging from US universities to government departments, and from supermarket chains to the world's largest banks. All of these customers have now been notified of the PageUp breach, and each of them is now notifying their own employees and job applicants of the security incident. It's because of the PageUp breach that the internet is abuzz today with a flurry of breach notifications that have been sent out by PageUp's clients. Internet service provider PageUp was unable to say what data the malware was able to steal from is systems and from which of its customers. The HR company said each customer stored different data, but that its investigation is still in its early stages to know what exactly had been compromised from each client's database. Even if it has limited details about the incident and the stolen data, PageUp went public today with its breach notification because of new privacy laws such as the EU's GDPR and Australia's Privacy Act These laws force companies to alert customers of breaches as soon as they learn of them so that users can take protective measures. \"The malware has been eradicated from our systems and we have confirmed that our anti-malware signatures can now detect the malware,\" PageUp said today. The HR company also said that it is currently working with law enforcement and a third-party security firm to dig through the forensic data and the determine the breach's scope. \"All client user and candidate passwords in our database are hashed using bcrypt and salted, however, out of an abundance of caution, we suggest users change their password,\" PageUp recommended.

Named Prowli and discovered by the GuardiCore security team, this botnet is a diverse operation that relies on vulnerabilities and credentials brute-force attacks to infect and take over devices. The following types of servers and devices have known to be infected by the Prowli group in recent months: Furthermore, the Prowli group also operates an SSH scanner module that attempts to guess the username and password of devices that expose their SSH port on the Internet. Once servers or IoT devices have been compromised, the Prowli group determines if they can be used for heavy cryptocurrency mining operations. Those that can are infected with a Monero miner and the r2r2 worm, a malware strain that performs SSH brute-force attacks from the hacked devices, and helps the Prowli botnet expand with new victims. Furthermore, CMS platforms that are used to run websites receive special treatment, because they are also infected with a backdoor (the Crook used this web shell to modify the compromised websites to host malicious code that redirects some of the site's visitors to a According to GuardiCore, the TDS system crooks worked with was EITest, also known as The big picture, according to researchers, is that the entire Prowli operation was intentionally designed and optimized to maximize profits for crooks. During its lifetime Prowli malware infected over 40,000 servers and devices located on the networks of over 9,000 companies, which it then used to their full potential to earn money before their malware was discovered. Prowli operated without discrimination and made victims all over the world, and regardless of the underlying platform. The VPNFilter malware that infected over 500,000 routers and NAS devices across 54 countries during the past few months is much worse than previously thought. According to new research technical details published today by the Cisco Talos security team, the malware —which was initially thought to be able to infect devices from Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, TP-Link, and QNAP— can also infect routers made by ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Ubiquiti, UPVEL, and ZTE. The list of devices vulnerable to VPNFilter has seen a sharp jump from Cisco's original report, going from 16 device models to 71 —and possibly more. The full list is embedded at the bottom of this article. Furthermore, researchers have also discovered new VPNFilter capabilities, packed as third-stage plugins, as part of the malware's tri-stage deployment system. Cisco experts said they discovered the following two new third-stage plugins. These two new plugins add to the two already known. Technical details about the VPNFilter malware, in general, are available in Cisco's The Below is the updated list of routers and NAS devices targeted by the VPNFilter malware. Instructions on how to safely remove the malware are available Microsoft has caved into developers and users who were angry that MS released an open-source project called GVFS even though that name was already associated with a long-standing Gnome project. Even after numerous developers and users explained this name confusion, Microsoft refused for over a year to rename the project. That was until yesterday, when finally Microsoft agreed to hold a vote for a new name for their project. Coincidentally, this change of heart occured only two days after purchasing GitHub and the concerns about this acquisition. Gnome, an open source desktop environment for Linux and BSD operating systems, has had a virtual filesystem implementation since around 2006 that is called \"Fast forward to November 2017 and Microsoft uploads a project called Once Microsoft release this project, they quickly overtook the original Gnome GVfs project in search rankings and started to cause confusion for some looking for information on the Gnome project. When developers saw this, they opened a After nine months, Microsoft posted that they would not be changing the name of their project as their is \"no confusion\" and that they are \"not actively considering a name change\". Needless to say, people were upset with this decision and felt that Microsoft was being arrogant and had little concern for the Linux and open source community. Over a year later and two days after Microsoft announces their acquisition of GitHub, a After the announcement that Microsoft was acquiring GitHub, many developers became concerned and started Is this sudden change of heart in renaming the project meant to try and regain some love from the developer community or simply a coincidence? Unfortunately, no way to tell and some feel it is too late. Bleeping Computer has reached out to Microsoft regarding the name change, but has not heard back at the time of this publication. Today Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17686 (Redstone 5) to insiders in the fast and skip ahead rings. This build adds local experience, privacy, and Windows Mixed Reality improvements. This build adds a new \"Region\" settings page that allows you to override various settings related to your default Region settings. For example, you can change the type of calendar you wish to use, which day is the first day of the week, and short date formats. A new \"Language\" settings page has been added that allows you to download \"Local Experience Packs\", which add new languages, from the Microsoft Store. When installing multiple languages, you can change the order they are displayed and the first one will be used for the text in navigation, menus, messages, settings, and help topics. You can access this new Language screen by going to If you have blocked access to your microphone in the settings, when you launch an App that wants to use it, Windows will display an alert asking you to review your privacy settings. You can now run Windows Mixed Reality without a monitor hooked up. You will still need a screen when setting up WMR for the first time, but you can configure it to automatically log you in, so you will no longer need it after. This build also includes improvements to video capture in WMR as well as apps now having the ability to use the Camera Capture UI API to capture images of the mixed reality world. The US government has filed new charges against Marcus Hutchins, the security researcher known as MalwareTech who stopped the WannaCry ransomware outbreak last year. According to court documents, the new charges are for allegedly creating another piece of malware and for lying to the FBI. Hutchins had According to US prosecutors, UPAS Kit \"used a form grabber and web injects to intercept and collect personal information from a protected computer,\" and \"allowed for the unauthorized exfiltration of information from protected computers.\" The US government claims Hutchins sold this second malware strain in July 2012 to a person going by the online pseudonym of Aurora123, who later infected US users. Furthermore, new charges accuse Hutchins of lying to the FBI agents who questioned him following his arrest last August. The US government claims that Hutchins lied when he said he didn't recognize the code he created as being part of the Kronos malware until 2016, when he first analyzed the malware. The FBI says that when Hutchins later admitted to creating and selling the Kronos malware to an individual named VinnyK in 2014, Hutchins indirectly admitted that he also lied in his first statement. But it's these statements that the FBI is clinging to —which are also crucial for US prosecutors— that Hutchins' lawyers are Hutchins' legal team says their client was interrogated while \"sleep-deprived and intoxicated,\" after a long of week parties at two Las Vegas security conferences, and without being informed of any charges or having been read his Miranda rights as a suspect in the US. The defendant's team argues that under these circumstances the evidence should be considered inadmissible. Legal expert and independent journalist Marcy Wheeler claims all today's new charges are a last-ditch attempt to prolong the Hutchins case, which many legal experts see heading towards a dismissal. \"The false statements charge is the best of all, because for it to be true a Nevada prosecutor would have to be named as Hutchins’ co-conspirator, because his representations in court last summer directly contradict the claims in this new indictment,\" Wheeler points out in an analysis of the Furthermore, Wheeler also highlights that the new charge of creating the UPAS Kit refers to alleged criminal acts that have taken place while Hutchins was a minor, and outside the standard five-year statute of limitations, so the prosecution shouldn't be able to charge him in the first place for two very different reasons. \"[Marcia Hofmann] and I are disappointed the government has filed this superseding indictment, which is meritless,\" Brian Klein, one of Hutchins' lawyers said on social media today. \"It only serves to highlight the prosecution’s serious flaws. We expect [Hutchins] to be vindicated and then he can return to keeping us all safe from malicious software,\" Klein added. Hutchins Legal and emotional pressure doesn’t really work on me, why not save a couple of years and try waterboarding instead? — MalwareTech (@MalwareTechBlog) If you'd like to assist me in fighting the new case, please consider donating said mineral here:A well-known Russian cyber-espionage group has subtly changed its modus operandi, moving to what security researchers from Palo Alto Networks are calling \"parallel attacks.\" These new \"parallel attacks\" are in stark contrast with what security researchers from multiple cyber-security firms have previosuly seen from Sofacy, a well-known APT (advanced persistent threat —a term used to describe nation-state hackers). For the past few years, this group —which has also been known under names like APT28, Sednit, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, and Tsar Team— has operated in a similar manner by targeting a small number of users inside an organization, usually with the same exploit chain and the same malware. But in a The first thing that jumped out to researchers is that instead of targeting a few key individuals inside an organization, the group is targeting a larger number of victims. \"The targeted individuals did not follow any significant pattern, and the email addresses were found easily using web search engines,\" said Palo Alto researchers Bryan Lee and Robert Falcone. \"This is a stark contrast with other attacks commonly associated with the Sofacy group where generally no more than a handful of victims are targeted within a single organization in a focus-fire style of attack.\" But besides targeting more users than usual, security experts have also noticed another new wrinkly in Sofacy's m.o.. According to Palo Alto, the group is now deploying multiple different attack methods to infect victims with varying strains of malware, sometimes at the same time, hence the name of parallel attacks. Palo Alto says it has seen the group using spear-phishing emails that spread Office documents laced with macros, Office documents leveraging a Victims who downloaded and ran these boobytrapped files are infected with the What was quite peculiar is that the three Zebrocy versions were coded in different programming languages (AutoIt, C++, Delphi), all of which were deployed in the recent attacks, sometimes against the same target organization. This, again, stood out as it was quite a unique tactic for an APT, and Sofacy in particular. \"In our research, we have not seen the Sofacy threat group use variations of the same tool developed in multiple languages for the same operating system as part of the same attack campaign,\" Lee and Falcone told Bleeping Computer via email yesterday. \"However, there has been at least two instances where they ported an existing tool to a completely new platform [As mentioned before, this shotgun approach of deploying different malware through different infection channels is not usually a method employed by APT groups, but rather by desperate low-level cyber-criminals looking to infect victims at any costs. The reason is that shotgun targeting through parallel exploit chains leaves attackers open to easier detection, as there's more artifacts that security software can pick up during attacks, rather than the low number of items that can be detected during carefully honed one-way approaches. Palo Alto says that Sofacy deployed these recent \"parallel attacks\" for campaigns targeting government organizations dealing with foreign affairs. The group didn't focus on particular countries, but targeted foreign affairs orgs all over the world, from North America to Asia. The Palo Alto report details Sofacy's most recent tactics. If our readers are interested in reading more and getting a deeper look into Sofacy's recent hacking efforts, Palo Alto has previously published reports detailing Sofacy's Adobe has issued a security update for Flash Player today to patch a zero-day vulnerability exploited by attackers in the wild. The vulnerability was discovered and independently reported by several security firms —ICEBRG, Tencent, and two security divisions from Chinese cyber-security giant Qihoo 360. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-5002, impacts Adobe Flash Player 29.0.0.171 and earlier versions. It was fixed with the release of Flash Player 30.0.0.113. According to Qihoo 360 Core Security, attackers used the Flash zero-day for attacks against targets in the Middle East. It is believed that a nation-state-backed cyber-espionage group is behind the attacks. \"We boldly suspected that the targeted region is Doha, Qatar,\" Qihoo 360 Core said today in a Experts say the hackers used Office files to exploit this Flash zero-day. Attackers would deliver Office files to victims that would load a malicious SWF file from a remote server and execute it inside the Office document. The malicious SWF file would exploit CVE-2018-5002 to gain the ability to execute code on the user's PC, and later infect him with another strain of malware. \"The attacker developed sophisticated plans in the cloud and spent at least three months preparing for the attack. The detailed phishing attack content was also tailored to the attack target,\" Qihoo experts said. \"All clues show this is a typical APT attack.\" \"We suggest all relevant organizations and users to update their Flash to the latest versions in a timely manner.\" Besides CVE-2018-5002, This is the second Flash Player zero-day spotted this year. In January, North Korean hackers deployed a Chinese firm Foscam has published firmware updates to address three vulnerabilities in multiple models of IP-based cameras. The flaws, when exploited, allow an attacker to take control of vulnerable cameras, and especially those left connected online via a public IP address. These vulnerabilities have been discovered in the past month by security researchers from VDOO, a company specialized in IoT security. VDOO says the three vulnerabilities are CVE-2018-6830, CVE-2018-6831, and CVE-2018-6832, and that an attacker can chain the three together in the following way to take over Foscam cameras. VDOO experts claim the security bugs occurred because of multiple reasons, such as (1) device processes running as root; (2) using external processes (shell commands) for trivial tasks instead of using programming APIs and libraries; (3) bad input sanitization; and (4) use of weak encryption to protect the device's firmware from external analysis. The good news is that Foscam responded positively to the VDOO report, and issued firmware updates to address the flaws in its products, This is a major change of attitude from a company that last year VDOO researchers said they have not seen any botnet or threat actor exploiting the reported issues before the publication of their report. Nonetheless, this will no doubt change, as botnet herders are known to be quick to weaponize IoT vulnerabilities to their advantage. VDOO has published a The VDOO write-up also contains the following table with the affected Foscam camera models and the firmware version that contains fixes for the reported issues. Instructions on how to update Foscam camera firmware are available Besides the camera models listed in the table below, camera models from other vendors are also affected. This is because Foscam is one of the biggest sellers of white-label IP cameras that other vendors buy and put their logo on top, without customers knowing they're actually running a Foscam device. Unfortunately, this information is impossible to track down, and users are left at the mercy of the second-hand buyer who is now responsible of taking the Foscam firmware patches and sending it downstream to its own customers. Google has announced that they are changing the look of their sign-in screens on June 14th 2018. These changes are purely cosmetic, but as some may be concerned that they are at the wrong site or are being phished, it is important to recognize what is being changed. In 2014, Google released an open source design system called Over time, Google has been updating their applications to utilize this new theme and it is now the The current Google sign-in screen looks like the following. On June 14th, Google's sign-in screen will begin to utilize the Material Design system, which will include \"tweaks to the Google logo, an outline around the text field, and center alignment of all items on the screen.\"  You can see this new sign-in screen below. While they have announced this on the G Suite blog, Google has told BleepingComputer that this change will appear globally on all Google Google sign-in screens and not only for G Suite customers. So if you you see a new look when signing into Google next week, don't freak out and think your being phished. Security researchers have spotted a malware strain targeting WordPress sites that includes some pretty clever self-preservation techniques, such as removing competing malware and updating the victim's site. Named BabaYaga, this malware strain isn't new, but recent updates have transformed this former low-key player into a considerable foe for WordPress site administrators. The group behind BabaYaga —believed to be Russian-speaking hackers— uses this malware to inject sites with special keyboards to drive SEO traffic to hidden pages on compromised sites. These pages are then used to redirect users to affiliate marketing links, where if the user purchases advertised goods, the hackers also make a profit. The malware per-se is comprised of two modules —one that injects the spam content inside the compromised sites, and a backdoor module that gives attackers control over an infected site at any time. The intricacies of both modules are detailed in much more depth in this \"[BabaYaga] is relatively well-written, and it demonstrates that the author has some understanding of software development challenges, like code deployment, performance and management,\" Defiant researchers say. \"It can also infect Joomla and Drupal sites, or even generic PHP sites, but it is most fully developed around Wordpress.\" But the things that stood out the most from BabaYaga's modus operandi are two functions that will update/reinstall a victim's site and remove competing WordPress malware. According to the Defiant team, the reason for these two functions is directly tied to the malware's ability to inject spam into compromised sites. \"Because so much of the primary functionality of BabaYaga executes alongside WordPress on page load, it requires the application to be working properly,\" the Defiant team says. \"If something breaks WordPress, then the malicious scripts don’t get executed when a page is visited.\" Hence, the reason the malware wants to keep the victim's site up to date, so it's always working properly, without bugs. Further, the BabaYaga-triggered update/reinstall mechanism isn't just a second-hand feature put together for the sake of it. The entire sequence of operations has received the group's full attention, and it's been carefully assembled, so much so that BabaYaga \"even handles the creation and cleanup of backup files, in the event that an upgrade fails.\" This same desire to keep a compromised site error-free is also the reason BabaYaga also scans the infected site and removes other known malware strains. The thinking is that some of this competing malware might be poorly coded, resulting in page load errors that indirectly lead to situations that might prevent BabaYaga from working. But besides its own selfish reasons for operating without errors, the BabaYaga crew also wants to keep the site without errors for another reason. That reason is that any site with errors generally draws the attention of its owner, who in his/her efforts to fix the problems might also discover BabaYaga's files and presence. All in all, in Defiant's own words, \"BabaYaga is an emerging threat that is more sophisticated than most malware.\" Security researchers have uncovered vulnerabilities affecting the firmware of Supermicro server products. Discovered by the Eclypsium team, these vulnerabilities affect both older and newer models of Supermicro products, but the vendor is working on addressing the issues. These vulnerabilities do not put the safety of Supermicro products at direct risk, as they can only be exploited via malicious software/code (aka malware) already running on a system. Nevertheless, exploiting these vulnerabilities allows the malware to obtain an almost permanent foothold on infected systems by gaining the ability to survive server OS reinstalls by hiding in the hardware's firmware. The first of the flaws uncovered by Eclypsium researchers is not an actual vulnerability in the firmware's code, but in the configuration of some Supermicro products. Researchers say that some of these products come with firmware that uses an improper setting for the \"Descriptor Region.\" The Descriptor Region is a security feature of Intel-based chipsets. This setting tells the chipset what areas of its own flash storage external parties can access to store data such as firmware or configuration files. According to Eclypsium researchers, some Supermicro products had an incorrectly set Descriptor Region that allowed software running on the OS (such as malware) to modify the Descriptor Region and then tamper with local firmware. \"Eclypsium researchers have observed vulnerable descriptor access controls through runtime examination of various server firmware models,\" the Eclypsium team wrote in a \"This manual analysis uncovered multiple server models that allowed writes to the flash descriptor from host software. According to Supermicro, some of the products we reviewed date back to 2008 and are currently EOL and no longer supported.\" But while modifying the Descriptor Region setting may be possible on some Supermicro products, tampering with the local firmware isn't as easy as it sounds, as several security mechanisms prevent malicious actors from altering a computer or server's most important code. Here is where the second series of issues that the Eclypsium team discovered came into play. \"We have observed insecure firmware updates through runtime examination of various systems. This manual analysis uncovered that Supermicro X9DRi-LN4F+ and X10SLM-F systems did not securely authenticate firmware updates,\" the research team said. \"We confirmed this result by intentionally modifying the binary in official Supermicro firmware images and observing that the system firmware still accepted and installed the modified package.\" But the issues didn't stop here, and the Eclypsium team also noted a lack of anti-rollback protections for firmware images. This anti-rollback protection is crucial for situations where the vendor checks for firmware authenticity. A firmware anti-rollback protection would prevent attackers from replacing newer firmware with an older (legitimate) firmware image that contains flaws that attackers can exploit and gain a foothold on all-of-a-sudden vulnerable systems. Eclypsium says it notified Supermicro about all the issues they discovered in the firmware of their products back in January. \"Supermicro has been supportive of our efforts and prioritized understanding and mitigating the issues we have discovered,\" Eclypsium says, \"For the current generation of products, Supermicro indicated that they have already implemented a signed firmware update for several products and are making this update generally available for all future systems. \"Similarly, for OEM customers who require rollback capability for their customized and locked firmware versions to ensure business continuity, Supermicro indicated that they are supporting anti-rollback as an option for their X11 generation firmware. \"The SPI flash descriptor is read-only on most boards and we are helping Supermicro identify specific models where this may be incorrectly set.\" For owners of Supermicro server hardware, Eclypsium has released instructions on how to check the descriptor access controls of their own systems. These procedures require installing and running the Bleeping Computer has sent a request for comment to Supermicro days before this article's publication. We asked Supermicro to confirm the Eclypsium research and inquired for a list of Supermicro platforms affected by the reported security issues, but we have not heard back before this article's publication time. Until Supermicro responds or publishes an official security advisory with a list of affected modules, Eclypsium CEO and Founder Yuriy Bulygin was kind enough to share with Bleeping Computer the list of Supermicro products they believe to be affected. \"For the missing UEFI update protections, it appears that a majority or all of X8, X9, X10 generation server products, and a majority of X11 generation server products are affected,\" Bulygin told Bleeping Computer via email. \"We don’t know exact number of affected models but we found 1184 unique firmware images for at least 233 unique X8-X11 server models.\" \"For the flash descriptor issue we found close to 500 firmware images with this issue which translates to about 110 different models (some of them may be old).

This time it was caused by an internal bug that set 14 million Facebook user's posts to be posted publicly. When posting on Facebook, users have the ability to specify who can see their posts. This could be Public (anyone), Friends, or Friends and Connections.  According to After the bug was detected, Facebook engineers spent 5 days resetting posts created by affected users to private, even if that was the original intent. \"We recently found a bug that automatically suggested posting publicly when some people were creating their Facebook posts,\" said Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, told CNN. \"We have fixed this issue and starting today we are letting everyone affected know and asking them to review any posts they made during that time.

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is now open to taking complaints from US users about cryptojacking —the practice of using JavaScript code to mine cryptocurrencies inside users' browsers without notifying them in advance or requesting permission. While cryptocurrency mining has been a thing for years and is the primary and only method through which new cryptocurrencies are generated, mining was usually done via special hardware rigs or custom software installed on users' computers. Generating cryptocurrency via these two methods has been usually pretty hard, especially for malware authors, as it required tricking users into install malware or hacking countless of servers across the web. But things radically changed last fall when a German company launched a web service named Coinhive that lets any website owner add a JavaScript library to their site and generate cryptocurrency by using the CPU power of site visitors, instead of the site owner's own hardware resources. Due to its easy implementation model —requiring only the loading of a JavaScript library— Coinhive usage exploded last September, with the Coinhive library Check Point's May most wanted malware list. Cryptojackers and adware galore. In-browser mining scripts have become today's hottest malware trend, and any crook looking for a quick profit is either deploying a cryptojacking JS script on hacked sites, gaming modules, browser extensions, desktop apps, and in any place capable of running JavaScript code. But despite its broad use, cryptojacking scripts is primarily a problem on the web, where users are bound to stumble upon one or more website or malicious browser extension that secretly tries to take advantage of their PCs' computational power. \"Cryptojacking scams have continued to evolve, and they don’t even need you to install anything,\" the \"Scammers can use malicious code embedded in a website or an ad to infect your device. Then they can help themselves to your device’s processor without you even knowing. \"You might make an unlucky visit to a website that uses cryptojacking code, click a link in a phishing email, or mistype a web address. Any of those could lead to cryptojacking,\" the FTC added. \"While the scammer cashes out, your device may slow down, burn through battery power, or crash.\" Today's FTC announcement is ground-breaking. This is the first official signal from US authorities that cryptojacking is an illegal practice, especially when done without the user's consent. \"It's a truly historic moment,\" Troy Mursch, a security researcher \"It's the first time a US government organization has mentioned the word cryptojacking,\" Mursch added. \"It's good to see them finally taking issues seriously and publishing that advisory.\" \"It will definitely help raise awareness on the issue, especially now that we've seen many governments and educational institutions affected in recent cryptojacking campaigns [The FTC is now asking users who think they are/were the subject of illegal cryptojacking while visiting online websites to file an official grievance with the Agency via its regular complaints page located at \"The individual user reports to the FTC I think will be helpful for the Agency to gauge the scope of the issue and hear from consumers that are affected,\" Mursch said. This is not the FTC's first rodeo in regards to illegal cryptocurrency mining operations. While not targeting in-browser (website-based) cryptocurrency mining, the FTC had taken action against illegal cryptocurrency mining in the past, twice —both times in 2015 [Besides enticing users to file official complaints, the FTC has also provided the following advice for dealing with in-browser cryptocurrency threats. Besides the FTC's advice for using antivirus products and ad blocker browser extensions to block websites with hidden cryptojacking scripts, we also want to add on this list Bleeping Computer has also published a Malspam campaigns, such as ones being distributed by Necurs, are utilizing a new attachment type that is doing a good job in bypassing antivirus and mail filters.  These IQY attachments are called Excel Web Query files and when opened will attempt to pull data from external sources.  The problem is that the external data being imported by the spreadsheet can also be a formula that will be executed by Excel. These formulas can then be used to locally launch PowerShell scripts that download and install malware onto the computer, which is explained later in the article. According to a The spam emails pretend to be purchase orders, scanned documents, or unpaid invoices that contain IQY attachments as shown below. When the IQY files are opened they connect to a remote site that executes PowerShell commands that ultimately download and install a preconfigured version of AMMYY Admin. AMMYY Admin is a legitimate remote administration tool that is being utilized by the attackers to gain remote access to a victim's computer. IQY files are simply text files that contain a few lines of text consisting of the source type, the source location, various parameters to be used during the query, refresh intervals, etc. The problem is that the data returned from the external source can also contain Excel formulas that launch applications on the computer. For example, to create a simple IQY file that opens the C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe file, I would create a file called test.iqy in Notepad and enter the following text: When a user opens the attachment, Excel will query the remote URL listed in the IQY file in order to retrieve data that will be imported into the spreadsheet. In our example, the test.txt file contains a formula that will be imported into Excel and then executed. In this case, the formula launches the Calc.exe program on the computer. The malspam campaigns are using the exact same method, but instead of starting Calculator, they are launching PowerShell commands that download and run scripts that ultimately install and execute malware on the computer. The good news is that Excel provides plenty of warnings when a user opens a IQY file that \"should\" indicate that something is not right. Unfortunately, people tend to ignore warnings and thus get infected. This is why it is important to understand what you would see when you open a malicious IQY document and to not just click on the Enable and Yes buttons. When an IQY file is first opened the user will be presented with a \"Microsoft Excel Security Notice\" that warns the user that an external data connection is being made. This is the first warning that something is not right and users should click on the \"If you instead click on the   If you ignore this warning too, then it's too late and your computer has been infected with some sort of malware. Therefore, be smart. Do not allow Excel to start other applications or create external connections or you will regret it. US law enforcement announced today the arrests of 74 individuals accused of orchestrating BEC (business email compromise) scams through which they stole millions from users across the world. Authorities arrested 42 users in the US, 29 in Nigeria, and one in Canada, Mauritius, and Poland, respectively. According to US authorities, among those arrested in BEC schemes include: US law enforcement agents said they also seized $2.4 million from the arrested suspects and recovered $14 million in fraudulent wire transfers. The arrests took place over the last two weeks and were part of Operation Wire Wire, an FBI-led investigation into business fraud, and especially BEC scams. This term —BEC scam— describes a form of cybercrime where crooks pose as the representatives of legitimate companies to establish email communications with that firm's business partners or customers, and then trick victims into transferring funds to bank accounts under the criminals' control. BEC scams have been the most damaging type of cybercrime in the US and across the world in the last two years. According to the FBI's 2016 and 2017 Internet Crime Report, BEC scams have caused losses to companies in the US and across the world of \"Foreign citizens perpetrate many BEC scams,\" said the US Department of Justice today in a press release announcing the arrest of the 74 suspects. \"Those individuals are often members of transnational criminal organizations, which originated in Nigeria but have spread throughout the world.\" The DOJ's assessment that many of these groups operate or have originated from Nigeria is consistent with recent reports from cyber-security firms such as It is believed that most of these BEC scam groups have evolved from the old Nigerian groups that sent \"419\" and \"Nigerian Prince\" scams in the 1990s. Many of these groups —known as \"yahoo-yahoo boys,\" \"yahoo boiz,\" or \"G-boys\"— evolved from sending email spam to During the past few years, BEC scams have proven to be very lucrative. Some of the most high-profile BEC scam incidents include: In May 2017, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) estimated that After today's arrests in Operation Wire Wire, the FBI's IC3 also published a Online crooks promoting fake \"giveaways\" have tricked people out of 8,148 Ether, currently worth around $4.3 million, according to statistical data compiled in EtherScamDB. The For the past few months, the website has been inventorying various types of Ethereum scams, such as classic phishing sites that imitate legitimate apps and wallets, trust-trading sites that push inaccurate advice or recommendations, but also online giveaways scams that promise to multiply Ether funds if victims transfer crooks a small sum of money. The latter category has recently become rampant on Twitter, and on a daily basis, the social network's most popular tweets are often inundated by these \"Ether giveaway\" scams. More precisely, this particular trend caught fire with crooks this past February after Bleeping Computer first reported that one particular Soon after our report, scams of these types started to flood Twitter left and right, with crooks registering Twitter accounts with names similar to legitimate ones, and then posting misleading messages, asking users to donate funds to an Ethereum address to receive a multiplied sum as part of a limited offer giveaway. Since then, these types of scams have grown exponentially, and crooks have resorted to imitating not just the Twitter accounts of official cryptocurrency services (exchanges, wallets apps, ICOs, mining pools, etc.) and celebrities, but also lesser known personalities like journalists, academics, and security researchers. Some of these scams and the Ether addresses where crooks have been collecting \"donations\" for the fake giveaways have been tracked in the EtherScamDB. According to a recent tweet by John Backus, founder of Bloom and Cognito, two blockchain-powered apps, crooks promoting these giveaway scams have made 8,148 Ether ($4.3 million) just from the Ether funds sent to the 468 Ethereum addresses tracked by the site. ETH giveaway scam stats:This sum is obviously larger, since the website does not track all giveaway scams, but even so, this small statistics shows how big this problem is today. Furthermore, while this scam can be carried out via email spam, Facebook or Instagram comments, Twitter has remained the crooks' favorite platform. Twitter, in particular, has been slow to respond to users reporting ake accounts, sometimes taking days or weeks to suspend obvious clones. Nevertheless, with a limited support staff, and with all the hate speech and terrorist propaganda happening on the platform, it is somewhat understandable why Twitter has been slow to react. In the meantime, spreading the word about this scam is probably the best way to educate users and remind them to pay attention to the Twitter handle from which these offers are being made. But while some might think the consensus advice is to tell users to \"PS: Some of these Ether giveaway scams have also been known to be promoted Still a hard problem.

These numbers are the results of in-depth research of the coin-mining malware scene by security researchers from Palo Alto Networks. The According to researchers, 84% of all malware samples they've detected were focused on mining for the Monero cryptocurrency, Because Monero-based coin-mining malware must embed in its source code the mining pool and Monero address through which the malware operates and collects ill-gotten funds, researchers have been able to track most of the money these groups generated on infected devices. By querying nine mining pools (which allow third-parties to query their payment stats) with the 2,341 Monero addresses researchers found embedded in the 531,6663 malware samples that focused on mining Monero, they were able to determine the amount of funds these groups have made in the past year. According to Palo Alto Networks researchers, criminal groups have mined an approximate total of 798,613.33 Monero coins (XMR) using malware on infected devices. That's over $108 million in US currency, just from coin-mining operations alone. This sum also represents around 5% of all the Monero currently in circulation —15,962,350 XMR. Furthermore, since mining pools also reveal a miner's hash rate —the speed at which a miner completes an operation— researchers were also able to determine the amount of Monero coin-mining botnets have been generating per day. Researchers say that during the past year, infected devices were responsible for 19,503,823.54 hashes/second, which is roughly 2% of the entire hashing power of the Monero network. \"The total hashrate of roughly 19MH/s would result in approximately $30,443 per day based on today’s current exchange rates and network difficulty,\" researchers said. \"Similarly, the top three hashrates will mine approximately $2,737, $2,022 and $1,596 per day, respectively.\" But despite some of the bigger actors making mountains of cash per day, not all the Monero addresses found in malware samples made any money. According to researchers, only 1,278 of the 2,341 addresses they found —roughly 55%— had collected more than 0.01 XMR (~$2.20) in their accounts. Researchers believe this is \"likely due to the malware being unsuccessful, or the attacker using a mining pool other than the ones [we] queried.\" Furthermore, of the 55% addresses that did contain funds, 244 earned 100 XMR ($13,500) or more, 99 wallets mined over 1,000 XMR ($135,000), and 16 wallets have obtained over 10,000 XMR ($1.35 million). These numbers are as accurate as they can be, as the Monero cryptocurrency was designed to prevent external third-parties from viewing the balance of an address without the private key. Querying the mining pools is the only way to determine the amount of money sent to a specific wallet, which in reality, is the best and most optimum way of evaluating a coin-mining botnet's profits and efficiency. Nonetheless, the Palo Alto Networks report only included data from nine mining pools only, meaning a large chunk of operational insight remains concealed. This is a known issue with the Monero landscape, where around 80% of the total hashrate can't be accounted for... 80% of the network hashrate is currently unknown ...and where most malware operators prefer to use off-the-grid mining pools or set up their own mining pool as a way to prevent the operators of larger mining pools to block the withdrawal of their funds following legal complaints. Monero mining pool with a \"botnet allowed\" policyOver 43 million email addresses have leaked from the command and control server of a spam botnet, a security researcher has told Bleeping Computer today. The leaky server came to light while infosec analyst Derrick Farmer was looking into a recent malware campaign distributing a version of the Trik trojan, which was later infecting users with a second-stage payload —the GandCrab 3 ransomware. Farmer discovered that Trik and GandCrab would download the malicious files that infected users' systems from an online server located on a Russian IP address. Farmer told Bleeping Computer that the group behind this operation misconfigured its server and left its content accessible to anyone accessing the IP directly. On this server, the researcher says he discovered 2201 text files, labeled sequentially from 1.txt to 2201.txt containing chunks of roughly 20,000 email addresses, each. The researcher believes the operators of this server have been using these email lists to send out spam messages containing boobytrapped files that infected users with the Trik malware. \"I pulled all of them to validate that they are unique and legitimate,\" Farmer told Bleeping Computer earlier today. \"Out of 44,020,000 potential addresses, 43,555,741 are unique.\" The researcher is now working with Australian security expert Troy Hunt, the owner of the Have I Been Pwned service, to determine how many of these emails are new and how many have been previously leaked in other data dumps. \"[The email addresses] are from everywhere,\" Farmer told us. \"Even my company and our clients' domains are in it. Everything from .gov to .com.\" Farmer has analyzed the files and broke down the email addresses per domain. In a list he shared with us earlier today (embedded at the bottom of this article), the researcher points out that the vast majority of email addresses are old, from antiquated email services such as Yahoo (10.6 million) and AOL (8.3 million). Surprisingly, while there are many custom email domains included in the leaked list, there are very few Gmail addresses included, suggesting the email addresses database is either incomplete, or this malware campaign intentionally targeted users using older email services. The Trik trojan is a classic malware downloader. It infects computers and assembles them into a giant botnet. The botnet's operators use these computers to send out new spam campaigns, or they sell \"install space\" to other crooks, allowing them to deliver more pontent threats to Trik victims, similarly to how they rented install space to the GandCrab crew for the campaign Farmer stumbled on. The Trik trojan has been an active threat for at least a decade but has recently seen a resurgence, according to this In its earlier days, the malware operated primarily as a worm that self-spread via removable USB storage devices, Skype, or Windows Live Messenger chats. These worm-based variants had previously been tracked under the name of The malware evolved into a fully-fledged trojan years later, when it forked the codebase of the SDBot trojan and started using email spam as its main delivery  infection mechanism, while also switching to an Trik is not the first spam botnet to leak its email addresses database. At the time of writing, the Trik CC server that's leaking email addresses keeps going offline at intermittent intervals. A bug existed in third-party Mac security programs from Facebook, Google, VirusTotal, and more that allow malware to appear as legitimate programs code-signed by Apple.  This bug is caused by the method the applications use to check if an executable is properly signed. This allows attackers to craft specially designed malware executables that could appear as signed by Apple even when they are not. When a developer code-signs an application, it embeds a signature into the executable that can be used to verify that the application has not been tampered with and that it is from the organization you expect it to be from. Some security utilities use these embedded signatures as a way to whitelist executables and users use them as a way to feel assured that a program is safe to execute. For example, if a program has a signature showing it was signed by Apple, you may feel more comfortable executing it, rather than an application that is not signed and provides no indication where it came from. According to research published by Okta security researcher A \"Fat file\" is a executable Mac file that can contain multiple binaries that are targeted towards a particular CPU type. This allows one executable to contain different versions of the same application that can run on different CPU architecure. Pitts research states that the malicious Fat file must be constructed in the following manner: The problem is that many third-party applications are not properly checking every component of the Fat file in order to check if the signature is valid. This causes the programs to verify only the first binary in the Fat file, which is the properly signed one by Apple, and then trust the rest of the sections of the file, even the malicious part. This causes the app to appear as if it is properly signed by Apple by to execute malicious code. When Pitts contacted Apple about this issue, \"Apple responded that third party developers should use kSecCSCheckAllArchitectures and kSecCSStrictValidate with SecStaticCodeCheckValidity API and developer documentation will be updated.\" When further pressed that these flags could be bypassed, Apple responded with \"Third-party developers will need to do additional work to verify that all of the identities in a universal binary are the same if they want to present a meaningful result.” Pitts recommends that developers use the In order to coordinate disclosure of this issue with 3rd party application vendors, Okta and Pitts contacted the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC). Along with CERT/CC all known third-party vendors were contacted prior to the disclosure of this bug. Pitts also provided a sample of a malicious Fat file that can be used by vendors to test their products. The research stated that the following vendors and their applications were affected. I have also include the known updates to these tools that resolve the vulnerability. While the above is a list of known third-party application, Pitts expects that many other applications are also vulnerable.

Microsoft has released the June 2018 Patch Tuesday security updates, and this month's release comes with fixes for 50 vulnerabilities. Fixes are included for the Windows OS, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, the ChakraCore JavaScript engine, and Microsoft Office and Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps. There are no Windows zero-days in this month's Patch Tuesday, but Microsoft patched CVE-2018-8267, a In addition to releasing the regular Patch Tuesday updates, Microsoft has also published This vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt and tamper with encrypted data without knowing the encryption key, and the attack can be performed both locally and/or over a network. Last but not least, the Microsoft June 2018 Patch Tuesday also includes a patch for Below is a table listing of all the security issues Microsoft fixed this month.

We hosted the full report on GitHub, If you're not interested in all security updates and you'd like to filter updates per product, you can use Microsoft's official Security Update Guide, available Google announced plans today to gradually remove the option of installing Chrome extensions from a remote website, also known as an \"inline installation.\" According to Google, this means that by the end of the year, users will only be able to install new Chrome extension only from their respective Chrome Web Store listings. The reason for this change is because of malicious Chrome developers who've abused this feature to trick users into installing confusing, deceptive, or downright malicious Chrome extensions. Until now, this has been possible because the inline installation process allowed developers to create extensions, have the extensions hosted on the official Chrome Web Store, but allow users to install the extensions just by clicking a button on a third-party website without the user ever visiting the extension's Chrome Web Store page. Google says that this interaction pattern has been abused by extension developers, who often used inline installation to distribute malicious Chrome extensions. This tactic has been quite successful because users never visited the Chrome Web Store listing, and would never see an extension's bad rating or negative user reviews, which often contained warnings or important clues about the extension's real behavior. Because of this repeated pattern of abuse, Google has now decided to remove the inline installation process from the Chrome browser and the Chrome Web Store altogether. The phase-out process will take place in three stages, detailed below: \"If you distribute an extension using inline installation, you will need to update install buttons on your website to link to your extension’s Chrome Web Store page prior to the stable release of Chrome 71,\" said James Wagner, Extensions Platform Product Manager at Google. In a plenary session of the European Parliament that will be held today in Strasbourg, France, members of the European Parliament (MEPs) This particular ban clause is included in A8-0189/2018 [The motion's purpose is to establish general guidelines for an EU-wide strategy on cyber defense. In the motion's lengthy body, there is also a clause that addresses public-private partnerships. According to clause #76, if the motion passes as proposed by the Foreign Affairs Commission, EU states will be called upon and expected to review and ban software programs that have been confirmed as malicious. The motion's text matter-of-factly refers to Kaspersky products as \"confirmed as malicious,\" following the lead set by the US last year. \"The wording ('confirmed') is interesting, but to fully appreciate it you need to be aware this report has its origins in the Foreign Affairs Committee where words like that matter,\" \"However, in context of 'cyber-activity', the wording also has a specific meaning in technology context. So you may have an impression of a deep insight. But more likely, it may be as simple as a reactive response to public press reports,\" Dr. Olejnik added. Today's EU Parliament vote comes after three other countries have taken steps against Kaspersky Lab. Previously, \"Policy-making process is lengthy, and at European Parliament, it takes even longer,\" Dr. Olejnik said. \"The continued string of action might be a cascading measure in response to the already known data, but it may as well be a consequence to the continuous pressure by the public opinion.\" All the cascading bans come after US authorities have accused the Moscow-based antivirus vendor of collaborating with Russian intelligence agencies. Kaspersky Lab has vehemently denied all accusations for the past year. The Russian company even Last month, Kaspersky announced the first details about this But despite Kaspersky's constant denial of spying on behalf of the Russian government, the company's reputation took a nosedive recently, as But to be clear, the proposed EU ban, if approved, applies only to the use of \"dangerous programs\" inside EU institutions and does not target the EU commercial software market. In the EU, the biggest repercussion of this proposed ban will be Kaspersky's relationship with Europol, which in the past has resulted in the arrest of countless cybercriminals and the creation of the It is unclear if this partnership will be allowed to continue, even if the ban refers to use of software programs. Europol and Kaspersky Lab spokespersons were not available for comment on the proposed ban and the future of the partnership between the two organizations. Eurozone experts expect a positive vote on today's A8-0189/2018 motion, mainly because the document is laden with crucial NATO cooperation clauses, cyber defense strategies, and other more important propositions. The A8-0189/2018 motion was the subject of a public plenary debate yesterday, June 12. The Why ban the company protecting Europeans from 320K malicious threats a day?

ZTE has been accused for years of These patches are currently not available for all Windows versions, though, and all mitigations are disabled by default. Only Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 have received SpectreNG patches. Furthermore, because of a constant stream of Meltdown and Spectre patching that has been going on for the last six months, it's been getting harder and harder for users to keep track of what patches they've received, what patch needs manual intervention, and which ones cause issues. To help system administrators with these confusing issues, Microsoft has published a table yesterday that contains the status of each of the Meltdown and Spectre patches it released since January 3, this year. Readers are advised that the table assumes they are running a Windows version with all the security patches installed and up to date, including yesterday's June 2018 Patch Tuesday updates train. If you're running an OS version where patches are disabled by default, the user must visit the linked KB article for additional information on how to enable the associated mitigation, if the user deems it necessary and in his threat model. Besides the above table, Microsoft has also admitted that some Meltdown and Spectre patches are still causing issues. Below is a list of known issues, which the company is currently working to address: Microsoft has patched a vulnerability in the Cortana smart assistant that could have allowed an attacker with access to a locked computer to use the smart assistant and access data on the device, execute malicious code, or even change the PC's password to access the device in its entirety. The issue was discovered by Cedric Cochin, Cyber Security Architect and Senior Principle Engineer at McAfee. Cochin privately reported the problems he discovered to Microsoft in April. The vulnerability is Cochin says the issue was present because of different quirks in how Cortana allows users to interact with the underlying Windows 10 OS, while in a locked state. The researchers discovered several features that could be combined into one larger attack: ?  Users can start typing after they say \"Hey Cortana\" and issue a voice command. This brings up a special search popup with various features and capabilities. ?  Users can type text in this popup, which searches the laptop's application index and its filesystem. By typing certain words, like \"pas\" (as in password), this search can bring up files containing this string in their file paths or inside the file itself. Hovering the mouse over one of these search results can reveal the file's location on disk, or the content of the file itself (big issue if the disclosed detail is a password). ?  Users can access the right-click menu after using the same trick of starting to type after triggering Cortana. These menus include various sensitive options, such as \"Open file location,\" \"Copy full path,\" \"Run as Administrator,\" or, the more dangerous one, \"Run with PowerShell.\" ?  Using the same trick of starting to type after issuing a Cortana voice command, attackers can execute files or run PowerShell commands. Combining all these issues into one attack, Cochin says that a hacker with access to a locked computer can carry out the following attack: Cochin published Users are advised to either update to the latest version of Windows, or disable Cortana on the lock screen. Starting today Microsoft is bringing the Fluent Design from Windows 10 to Office 365. This design is aimed to offer more a streamlined interface with depth, the right amount of colors, and transition animations that make using Office a cleaner and easier experience. This new design is being rolled out gradually, with the new interface coming today for Word users on Office.com  Later this month, a test group of Office Insiders will will see them in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for Windows. Starting in July, it will be available in Outlook for Windows and Outlook for Mac in August. This Fluent update brings a simplified ribbon to Office that contains new icons and colors that make it easy to use while working. Included in the ribbon will be new collaborative controls that allow you to see small avatars of others who are working with you on the document, the ability to easily share the documents, and access to the comments pane. The ribbon bar icons have also been updated to use less color and more detail so that they are not distracting and offer a cleaner look. You can see the evolution of Microsoft Office icons over the years in the image below. In addition to the Fluent Design being added, Microsoft has added a new search experience that uses machine learning and Microsoft AI. In addition to allowing you to search for documents or text within documents, this new search also includes a feature called \"zero query search\"  Zero query search allows you to simply click in the search field and before you type anything, Microsoft AI will offer a list of related documents, people you can collaborate with, and commands that you may want to execute. This new search feature is already available in Office.com, SharePoint Online, and the Outlook mobile app and will be rolling out to Outlook on the web in August. UK-based electronics retailer Dixons Carphone, the company behind the Currys PC World, OneStopPhoneShop, and Carphone Warehouse brands, announced a security incident earlier today. In a The breach appears to have taken place \"in one of the processing systems of Currys PC World and Dixons Travel stores,\" the company said. After analyzing the data accessed by the intruder, Dixons Carphone says that the vast majority of exposed payment card details —around 5.8 million— belonged to payment cards that featured chip and PIN protection, meaning the stolen data can't be used without the PIN and card verification value (CVV) number (inscribed on the back of the card). The company says that the rest of the exposed cards, around 105,000, belonged to individuals located in non-EU countries, and did not feature chip and PIN protection. This means the intruder might use them for making illegal online purchases or committing other forms of online fraud. Dixons Carphone said it notified card companies of the breach, so they could take precautionary measures to protect customers. \"We have no evidence of any fraud on these cards as a result of this incident,\" a company spokesperson said. In addition to payment card details, the UK electronics retailer also said the intruder accessed the personal details of over 1.2 million customers. Exposed details include only non-financial personal data, such as names, addresses, or email addresses. \"We have no evidence that this information has left our systems,” the UK retailer said, adding that it started notifying each of the affected clients. The same retailer suffered a similar breach in 2015. While the actual breach might have taken place last year in July, questions remain about when the UK retailer learned of the incident. \"In light of these facts, Dixons Carphone's decision to disclose - is rather laudable, albeit one may question the timeline of the disclosure,\" said Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and founder of web security company High-Tech Bridge. \"Many other companies are much less courageous to tell the truth, as even in light of GDPR enforcement, the new law cannot monitor proper disclosure of inconspicuous data breaches.\" \"We are extremely disappointed and sorry for any upset this may cause,\" Dixons Carphone Chief Executive, Alex Baldock, said. \"We've taken action to close off this unauthorised access and though we have currently no evidence of fraud as a result of these incidents, we are taking this extremely seriously. We are determined to put this right and are taking steps to do so; we promptly launched anThe UK's GCHQ National Cyber Security Centre has also put out an The Docker team has pulled 17 Docker container images that have been backdoored and used to install reverse shells and cryptocurrency miners on users' servers for the past year. The malicious Docker container images have been uploaded on Docker Hub, the official repository of ready-made Docker images that sysadmins can pull and use on their servers, work, or personal computers. These Docker images allow sysadmins to quickly start an application container within seconds, without having to create their own Docker app container, a complicated and painstaking process that not all users are technically capable or inclined to do. Just like it happened with other package repositories in the past —such as Python [Because new Docker images don't go through a security audit or testing process, these images were listed on the Docker Hub portal right away, where they remained active between May 2017 and May 2018, when the Docker team finally intervened to pull them down. All 17 images were uploaded on the Docker Hub portal by the same person/group, using the pseudonym of \"docker123321.\" Some of these packages have been installed more than one million times, while others were used hundreds of thousands of times. Signs that something was wrong on the Docker and Kubernetes (app for managing Docker images at a large scale) scene started appearing last September and continued through the winter. Users reported that malicious activity was happening on their cloud servers running Docker and Kubernetes instances. Reports of security incidents involving Docker images were posted on Several security firms and security researchers such as Even Bleeping Computer ran But while the number of security incidents grew, it was only when Fortinet and Kromtech got involved that all the pieces surrounding these hacks got put together, and researcher tracked down all these incidents to the docker123321 account. Docker removed the 17 backdoored images from Docker Hub on May 10, this year, a week after Fortinet published a Today, Kromtech published a According to current evidence, in the vast majority of cases, attackers used these poisoned Docker images to install XMRig-based Monero miners on victims' machines. In just one campaign the Kromtech team managed to track down, they say the docker123321 actor mined 544.74 Monero using his victims' servers, which is about $90,000 at today's exchange rate. Other campaigns using other Monero wallet addresses might store even more ill-gotten funds. Nonetheless, Kromtech researchers warn that some of these images also contained backdoor-like capabilities thanks to the embedded reverse shells. This means that even if victims stopped using or removed the malicious Docker images, the attacker could have very easily obtained persistence on their systems through other means, possibly granting them access to the system at a later time. Wiping systems entirely is probably the safest bet for users who've used one of the 17 Docker images listed in the tables above. \"For ordinary users, just pulling a Docker image from the DockerHub is like pulling arbitrary binary data from somewhere, executing it, and hoping for the best without really knowing what’s in it,\" Kromtech researchers said, explaining the dangers of using unvetted code from a public repository like Docker Hub. When dealing with Docker and Kubernetes-based environments, the safest bet is to use your homemade Docker images or by using verified images, whenever possible. Microsoft has released the criteria used to determine whether a reported and confirmed vulnerability is resolved through a security update or in the next version of Windows. These criteria were released in order to provide insight into the decision making progress and to receive feed back from security researchers. According to Microsoft, when a vulnerability is reported they evaluate how it should be handled by asking two questions. If the answer to both of those questions is \"Yes\", then a security update will be released. On the other hand, if the answer to either of the questions is \"No\", then the vulnerabilitity is usually, but not always, pushed towards being fixed in a new version of the software instead.  For security boundaries, Microsoft is committed to protecting them, but interestingly not all Windows security features have that same promise. A \"Security Boundary\" is For example, a violation of the \"Kernel Boundary\" would be if a user mode process is able to access and modify the data or code of the Kernel. Another example that violates the \"Virtual Machine Boundary\" is if a process in a Guest virtual machine could modify the data or code of the host machine or another guest virtual machine. Other security boundaries include the Network boundary, Process boundary, AppContainer sandbox boundary, Session boundary, Web browser boundary, Virtual Secure Mode boundary.  Microsoft has committed to protecting all of these boundaries from vulnerabilities that could potentially bypass them. While Microsoft is committed to protecting all security boundaries, not all security features are treated the same way. Microsoft explains how they are committed to protecting some security features, but there are other features called \"Defense-in-depth\" features that they do not have the same commitment. For example, some security features have an expectation to work as intended, and if they don't, Microsoft promises to resolve them. These include \"Windows Hello / Biometrics\", \"Secure Boot\", and \"Bitlocker\", which all have a strict definition as to how they are intended to secure a computer and its data. On the other hand, \"Defense-in-depth\" features are ones that are intended to protect some aspect of Windows, but have no promise to do so. This is because they require an existing \"security boundary\" to be breached in order to exploit them. Thus fixing the more critical vulnerability in the boundary would protected the defense-in-depth feature from being exploited. These defense-in-depth features include applications such as The last part of the decision process is the On the other hand, if it does not meet both of these criteria, the vulnerability may not be fixed until a new Windows update is released. Kaspersky Lab announced today that it was temporarily halting its cooperation with Europol following the voting of a controversial motion in the European Parliament today. The motion was voted today in a plenary session of the European Parliament and received 476 votes in favor, 151 against, while 36 MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) abstained. The motion is A8-0189/2018 [Among the motion's clauses is one that calls on EU states to review the software and equipment they use in the IT infrastructure of EU institutions. The document advises EU states to exclude and ban programs and equipment that have been confirmed as malicious. The issue that angered Kaspersky Lab officials was that this particular clause specifically mentioned the Russian-based antivirus vendor by name when the motion's authors attempted to give an example of a product \"confirmed as malicious.\" 76.

The company has been one of the first antivirus companies who signed collaboration agreements with Europol and state-level law enforcement agencies. In addition, together with Europol, Dutch Police, and McAfee (formerly Intel Security), Kaspersky was one of the founding members of The European Parliament Research Services recognized the NoMoreRansom project as a successful case of public-private cooperation in a recent report. Ensuing today's vote, Kaspersky Lab formally announced it would temporarily halt its cooperation with Europol officials and work on the NoMoreRansom project. \"We have protected the EU for 20 years working with law enforcement leading to multiple arrests of CYBERCRIMINALS,\" Kaspersky Lab CEO, Eugene Kaspersky wrote today on Twitter, following the EU Parliament vote. \"Based upon today’s decision from the EU Parliament, we are forced to freeze our cooperation with orgs including Europol  NoMoreRansom,\" he added. \"The way we conducted [this] public-private partnership is unfortunately ceased until the withdraw of the European Parliament decision.\" We have protected the EU for 20 years working with law enforcement leading to multiple arrests of CYBERCRIMINALS. Based upon today’s decision from the EU Parliament, we are forced to freeze our cooperation with orgs including \"Although this report has no legislative power it demonstrates The entire fault of this debacle strictly falls on the EU Parliament and its Foreign Affairs Commission, which was responsible for wording the report. The inclusion of Kaspersky's name on the report is mindboggling. In April this year, before the motion's last wording, an EU representative The EU spokesperson, answering on behalf of the Commission, said \"the Commission [had] no indication for any danger associated with [the Kaspersky] anti-virus engine.\" In spite of this, the company's name was later included as an example of \"confirmed as malicious\" programs in the motion's final text. The Russian AV vendor is now in danger that EU states looking into enforcing the joint cyber defense strategy may be taking the report a little bit too literally and may enforce bans without being given any palpable evidence, just by going on its text.

Supporting older versions of operating systems can become a development nightmare, especially when components of your application rely on third-party applications and security features of newer operating systems. Such is the case with the Steam client that already relies on on an embedded version of Chrome that no longer works on Windows XP and Windows Vista. This causes some features such as the new The Steam It is not know what Windows features and updates Steam is referring to, but they advise all users to upgrade to newer versions of Windows in order to continue using the Steam client and all its features.

What a horrible year in security for Intel. First we had the \"Lazy FPU context switching\" is a performance optimization feature used by operating systems that only saves and restores the FPU (Floating Point Unit) registers, which are locations in the CPU that are used to store floating point numbers, when needed. A bug in the actual Intel CPUs allows another process to access these registers and the data within them. The problem is that these numbers are used for a variety of tasks, including cryptographic equations. This could allow an attacker to sniff out numbers that make it easier to crack an encryption key. Thankfully, researchers statde that this vulnerability would be difficult to execute via a web browser, so its impact is less than previous speculative execution vulnerabilities such as Meltdown. You can read more about the technical aspects of this vulnerability in this Twitter thread by So about that \"Lazy FPU\" vulnerability (CVE-2018-3665)... this probably ought to be a blog post, but the embargo just ended and I think it's important to get some details out quickly. — Colin Percival (@cperciva) Rumors about this bug have been The good news is that this vulnerability does not require new CPU microcodes from Intel, but can be fixed instead by operating system updates. Since Intel's advisory was posted, various Linux distributions and Microsoft have posted advisories related to this new vulnerability. Below is a list of links to current advisories or information. As more advisories are posted, we will update this article. Microsoft fixed yesterday a faulty Debian package that was messing with users' OS settings during its installation routine. The faulty package that was causing all the problems was Open R v3.5. Open R is an enhanced version of the R programming language maintained by Microsoft. The faulty package forcibly relinked Furthermore, the package also forcibly removed Preining \"While we work hard to be a good steward in all the open source communities we participate in, this one did not stand up to the community's or our high expectations,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said. \"We have put processes in place to help us fix things like this as soon as they are discovered (this issue was identified in 2016 but wasn't fixed) and named individuals have been identified to monitor and address any issues as soon as possible. We are lucky at Microsoft to have many experienced Linux contributors at our company, and we will do better at getting their input going forward,\" Microsoft added.

According to GitHub, Microsoft has the largest open source community in the entire world with Visual Studio Code. if this is a surprise, you weren't paying attention ;) Cybercriminals are currently developing a new strain of malware targeting Android devices which blends the features of a banking trojan, keylogger, and mobile ransomware. Named MysteryBot, this malware strain is still under development, according to security researchers from ThreatFabric, who recently ran across this new threat. ThreatFabric says MysteryBot appears to be related to the well-known and highly popular LokiBot Android banking trojan. \"Based on our analysis of the code of both Trojans, we believe that there is indeed a link between the creator(s) of LokiBot and MysteryBot,\" a ThreatFabric spokesperson told \"This is justified by the fact that MysteryBot is clearly based on the LokiBot bot code,\" the spokesperson added. Furthermore, according to a report the company published yesterday, the recent MysteryBot malware sends data to the same command and control (CC) server used in a past LokiBot campaign, clearly suggesting they are being controlled and developed by the same person or group. The reasons why the LokiBot group is now developing MysteryBot are unknown, but they may be related to the fact that the LokiBot source code leaked online a few months back. Several cyber-crime groups have jumped on the LokiBot code and are also using it now, and the LokiBot crew may be trying to come up with a new malware family they can market on underground forums like they did with the original LokiBot. \"To our knowledge, MysteryBot is not advertised in underground forums at the moment, probably due to the fact that it is still under development,\" ThretFabric told us. It also appears that the authors of MysteryBot are taking the job of creating something new and worth paying for seriously. ThreatFabric says MysteryBot is unique in many ways compared to LokiBot, but also with other Android banking malware such as ExoBot 2.5, Anubis II, DiseaseBot, or CryEye. For starters, MysteryBot appears to be the first banking malware that can reliably show \"overlay screens\" on Android 7 and Android 8. Banking malware uses these overlay screens to show fake login pages on top of legitimate apps. Due to the security features Google engineers added in Android 7 and 8, no malware was able to show overlay screens on these OS versions in a consistent manner. The problem was that previous malware strains showed the overlay screens at the wrong time because they couldn't detect when the user was viewing an app on his screen and would miscalculate the time when it should show the overlay, giving away its presence by prompting the user to log in at the wrong time. According to ThreatFabric, the MysteryBot team appears to have found a reliable way to time its overlay screens at show them at the proper time when the user opens and brings an app into the foreground. They did this by abusing the Android PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS permission (commonly named Usage Access permission), an Android OS feature that shows usage stats about an app, and indirectly leaks details about the currently used app. The current, in-dev version of MysteryBot includes custom-made \"overlay screens\" for a slew of mobile e-banking (from Australia, Austria, Germany, Spain, France, Croatia, Poland, Romania) and IM apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Viber (listed in full The malware targets over 100 apps in total, and researchers expect MysteryBot to bolster its screen overlay arsenal in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the malware also comes with a keylogger component, which is also unique when compared to other keyloggers found on the Android market. Researchers say that instead of taking screenshots at the moment the user presses a key on the touch-based keyboard to determine what the user is typing, MysteryBot records the location of a touch gesture instead. This new keylogger component then tries to guess what key the user has pressed based on the touch gesture's screen position on a virtual keyboard the malware imagines the user is using. ThreatFabric says this component isn't working just yet, as current versions don't do anything with the logged data, such as sending it to a remote server. Last but not least, The ransomware doesn't encrypt files but locks each one in an individual password-protected ZIP archive. Researchers say the ransomware module is quite shoddy coded. For starters, the ZIP archive password is only eight characters long, meaning it could be very easily brute-forced. Second, this password and the user's custom-generated infected device ID are sent to a remote control panel named Myster_L0cker (image below). The problem is that the ID assigned to each victim can be a number between 0 and 9999 only, and there's no verification of pre-existing IDs when sent to the remote control panel. Passwords for older victims can be easily overwritten on the control panel when a new victim with the same ID syncs to the MysteryBot backend. ThreatFabric says the current versions of MysteryBot it spotted until now have been disguised as a Flash Player app for Android. \"In general, the consumer must be aware that all of the so called 'Flash Player (update) apps' that can be found in and outside the various app stores are malware,\" ThreatFabric told \"Many web sites still require visitors to have support for Flash (which has not been available on Android for many years) causing Android users to try and find an app that will let them use that web site,\" the spokesperson added. \"In the end they will just end up installing malware.\" While MysteryBot is currently not in circulation, ThreatFabric told us that LokiBot was previously spread via SMS spam (smishing) and emails (phising) containing links to an Android app. Users were supposed to side-load this malicious app and then grant the app access to the Android Accessibility service before the malware could do any damage. It is safe to say that MysteryBot may be distributed in the same way, based on the existing connections to the LokiBot crew. Experts recommend that users avoid side-loading (installing) apps from outside the Play Store, and avoid granting apps access to the Accessibility service, which in the vast majority of cases is used mostly by malware. In its current form, MysteryBot still needs access to the Accessibility service, which it uses for its keylogger and ransomware components. The malware also uses access to the Accessibility service to grant itself permission to access the PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS feature without prompting the user. This means that users may still be able to spot MysteryBot before getting infected when they're prompted to allow an app access to the highly-privileged Accessibility service. Furthermore, users should also pay attention to what they're downloading from the Play Store as well. \"There are still many droppers on the Google Play Store as it seems to be an efficient mean of distribution,\" ThreatFabric said. \"However, most Android banking Trojans seem to be distributed via smishing/phishing  side-loading.\" You may not be getting a banking trojan, but you're getting malware nevertheless. 9 more apps with 130K+ installs based on Play Store Gal Vallerius, a 36-year-old French national pleaded guilty this week in the US of selling narcotics on the Dark Web under the nickname of OxyMonster. US authorities arrested Vallerius in September last year, at the Atlanta airport after he arrived in the US to attend and participate in the World Beard and Mustache Championships that was being held in Austin, Texas. According to court documents, US authorities managed to identify Vallerius as OxyMonster and keep him under surveillance after they discovered one of his Bitcoin accounts. In a The tip jar was meant to allow users or buyers to tip Vallerius for his services. Unlike most vendors on the Dream Market, OxyMonster did not configure the tips to go through the marketplace's internal payment systems, which passed transactions through a tumbler/mixer (transaction anonymizer), but set the tip jar to receive funds in a Bitcoin address he set up. This allowed law enforcement to get an initial clue of who may be behind the OxyMonster monicker. Their suspicions were later confirmed when an analysis of OxyMonster and Vallerius' writing styles suggested they were the same person. When Vallerius traveled to the US for the first time last fall, border agents subjected him to a search in the airport. A search of his laptop, which was later seized, confirmed that Vallerius was OxyMonster. Agents found incriminating evidence on the laptop, such as the PGP encryption key that OxyMonster used to sign messages online, OxyMonster login credentials for the Dream Market, and Bitcoin wallets containing Bitcoin addresses associated with OxyMonster's vendor accounts. The original criminal complaint tried to peg OxyMonster as a seller of several controlled substances such as cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine, LSD, and oxycodone. After nine months trying to avoid a lifetime prison sentence in the US, Vallerius signed a guilty plea this week, admitting to selling Oxycodone and Ritalin on the Dream Market under the name of OxyMonster. Besides OxyMonster, Vallerius also went on Dark Web markets as VanDeevp, and had accounts on multiple marketplaces, such as AlphaBay, Hansa Market, TradeRoute, Valhalla, and Evolution. Despite his crimes and how authorities tracked him down, OxyMonster will always be remembered for his glorious beard and the silly way he was arrested. All in all, this is just another case where authorities have proven once more that Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency isn't really anonymous as it was advertised for the past decade. The authors of the Satan ransomware have rebranded their \"product\" and they now go by the name of DBGer ransomware, according to security researcher The change was not only in name but also in the ransomware's modus operandi. According to the researcher, whose discovery was later confirmed by an The purpose of DBGer incorporating Mimikatz is for lateral movement inside compromised networks. This fits a recently observed trend in Satan's modus operandi. The Satan ransomware First versions were unsophisticated, as most new ransomware variants tend to be. For a long time, the Satan crew rented its ransomware to other crooks, who then distributed it to victims, mostly via email spam (malspam) campaigns. With time, the ransomware gained a lot of reputation and clients on the criminal underground. The group behind the LockCrypt ransomware But the Satan crew didn't stand idly either. As the ransomware scene evolved in 2017, they evolved as well. Changes in the ransomware scene of 2017 included self-spreading mechanisms (seen in the three ransomware outbreaks of last year) and a move to infecting larger networks instead of home users (because of larger payouts and payout rate). Around November 2017, Satan devs started their plans of updating the ransomware to better fit these trends. The first step they took was to incorporate a version of the This mechanism has been previously analyzed by security researcher Bart Parys in a blog post Other ransomware strains that used EternalBlue included WannaCry, NotPetya, and This focus on bolstering a lateral movement system continued in 2018, as the ransomware received another update to its lateral movement mechanism at the start of May. AlienVault experts The new (Satan) DBGer ransomware strain continues this focus on lateral movement. The new version spotted today works by dropping Mimikatz, dumping passwords for networked computers, and using these credentials to access and infect those devices as well. The development path we see taken by the Satan/DBGer crew is what we can expect in the coming months from most ransomware strains. Cybercrime gangs have understood by now that there is more money to be made from coin-mining campaigns rather than ransomware. The groups who are still active on the ransomware scene will need to improve their code to maximize profits and adding self-spreading and lateral movement mechanisms is the simplest way to do that. This is because self-spreading and lateral movement features in ransomware allow a crook the opportunity to infect and receive multiple ransom payments just by fooling one absent-minded employee to open a boobytrapped file. With today's release of Windows Insider Build 17692, Microsoft announced that their Swiftkey keyboard application will now become the touch keyboard for Windows 10. Using Swiftkey, users will get autocorrection and predictive typing in multiple languages as the application learns a particular user's writing style.  The integration of this keyboard also brings us one step closer to Microsoft enabling its upcoming During the May 2017 Build event's keynote, Microsoft When Microsoft purchased SwiftKey in 2016, it was assumed it was for the program's artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms used for its predictive typing. With Cloud Clipboard being poised to use this app as well, the applications huge mobile base and highly rated reviews will allow Microsoft to further integrate Windows 10 with mobile users. Today Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17692 (Redstone 5) to insiders in the fast and skip ahead rings. This build adds a bunch of new features such as SwiftKey becoming the new touch keyboard, Edge getting autoplay video controls, search improvements, and more.  With this build, the SwiftKey app will now be used as the Windows 10 touch keyboard. As Microsoft has added video autoplay controls into Microsoft Edge to control whether videos are autoplayed on sites that you visit. Microsoft has added an early preview of this feature under “Advanced Settings” - “Allow sites to automatically play media.” For those who wish to test Edge using WebDriver, in this build WebDriver is added as an optional feature. This allows you to install the correct version of WebDriver on the version of Windows that you are using. A new Ease of Access setting has been added that allows you to make the text larger throughout Windows 10. This includes on the Start Menu, File Explorer, Win32 apps, and even UWP apps. To access this setting you can go to  Settings  Ease of Access  Display and you will see a “Make everything bigger” slider that you can use to make the text smaller and larger. Microsoft has stated that there are some known bugs when it comes to changing DPI settings and some issues with text clipping when using this feature. In this release, Microsoft added some improvements to the Game Bar. These include the ability to adjust the audio volume, change the default output device, and see frame rate, CPU usage, GPU memory usage, and system memory usage. Microsoft has also added the ability to improve the gaming experience on Desktop PCs by enabling the \"Dedicate resources\" option in the Game Bar.  Search has been improved so that you can easily download programs from the Internet directly from within the Start Menu. This feature is a server-side change, so users of other insider builds may see this as well. With this build you can stream audio to both your mixed reality headset and to your computer's speakers at the same time. To enable this feature, shut down all Mixed Reality apps, including the Mixed Reality Portal, and go to to Settings  Mixed reality  Audio and speech and enable “When Mixed Reality Portal is running, mirror headset audio to desktop.”  The Microsoft Edge browser will gain the ability to block auto-playing media, such as sounds and web videos. The feature was announced today for Edge browsers part of Insiders program, Microsoft's testing ground for new Windows 10 features. The ability to block auto-playing media will land in the mainstream Edge distribution this fall when Microsoft launches the next major version of the Windows 10 operating system. The feature is not enabled by default, in its current form. Microsoft engineers have added a new setting in Microsoft Edge to allow users to control whether sites can autoplay media. The feature is located in \"We’ll be improving these options and adding additional controls in upcoming [Windows 10 Insiders] flights and in response to your feedback,\" Microsoft said today. Chrome already blocks auto-playing media since Chrome 66, Also today, Microsoft announced that Edge will also support The feature has been added in the current Edge version bundled with Insiders builds, and will also be generally available starting next fall. The WebDriver technology will replace existing tools such as Selenium, used by some apps and server software to automate browser-based interactions, such as taking screenshots of web pages, automating clicks, auto-filling forms, testing websites layouts, and more. Microsoft also made Edge's WebDriver support a \"Feature On Demand,\" meaning Windows will update WebDriver-related files via the regular Windows Update mechanism, keeping Edge's automation support always up to date. To turn on the WebDriver auto-update feature, just enable Developer Mode in Windows 10.

The campaign has been raging for the past week and has spread a malware which Qihoo researchers have named The malware's purpose is to intercept content recorded in the Windows clipboard, look for strings resembling Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses, and replace them with ones owned by the malware's authors. ClipboardWalletHijacker's end-plan is to hijack BTC and ETH transactions, so victims unwittingly send funds to the malware's authors. The malware will use the following addresses when replacing strings in users' clipboards:          Checking the balances of these addresses using Blockchain.info (Since Qihoo 360 is a vendor with the vast majority of its presence on the Chinese market, it is believed that most of the 300,000 infected PCs are located in China and neighboring countries.

They've also stumbled upon Researchers also uncovered Qihoo also discovered the A Chinese-linked cyber-espionage unit has hacked a data center belonging to a Central Asian country and has embedded malicious code on government sites. The hack of the data center happened sometime in mid-November 2017, according to a Experts assigned the codename of LuckyMouse to the group behind this hack, but they later realized the attackers were an older Chinese threat actor known under various names in the reports of other cyber-security firms, such as Emissary Panda, APT27, Threat Group 3390, Bronze Union, ZipToken, and Iron Tiger [Kaspersky researchers say LuckyMouse used access to the data center to add JavaScript code to government sites, which redirected users to malicious sites hosting exploitation tools such as On these sites, these tools would attempt to infect users with HyperBro, a remote access trojan that operated via an \"in-memory\" state, leaving minimal traces on disk that could be identified by antivirus solutions. Researchers say they found evidence of this end-user infection campaign taking place from December 2017 to January 2018. Kaspersky didn't name the Central Asian country, but they did say LuckyMouse targeted it before in previous campaigns. The Russian antivirus vendor also didn't say how hackers breached the data center hosting government sites, as they didn't have enough evidence to formulate a conclusion. Another detail that also stood out was that LuckyMouse appears to have hacked a MikroTik router to host the command and control server of the HyperBro RAT. Attackers would use this router to control and retrieve data from infected victims, putting an additional layer of anonymity between them, victims, and forensic investigators. This is not the first time that nation-state hackers have used routers as part of their attack infrastructure, this being \"The most unusual and interesting point here is the target.

Pre-crime, is a vast potpourri of information, on everyday activities, used to try to predict and prevent future behavior. In “predictive” policing, computer algorithms identify signs ofHartford, CT is now using what some BriefCam, An Israeli-American cyber business, provides video search technology that is now being utilized in Hartford. BriefCam's video analysis software compresses hours of video into more compact presentations, referred to as \"events.\" In cities comparable to Hartford, with at leastLaw enforcement's foray into utilizing this type of technology is not without its critics. Local residents and state chapters of the ACLU are uneasy with police departments' use of technology for which they say the endgame seems disturbingly clear. Currently being employed in Fresno, CA, one example of the use of pre-crime technology is described by the \"...officers raced to a recent 911 call about a man threatening his ex-girlfriend, a police operator in headquarters consulted software that scored the suspect’s potential for violence the way a bank might run a credit report. The program scoured billions of data points, including arrest reports, property records, commercial databases, deep Web searches and the man’s social- media postings. It calculated his threat level as the highest of three color-coded scores: a bright red warning. The man had a firearm conviction and gang associations, so out of caution police called a negotiator. The suspect surrendered, and police said the intelligence helped them make the right call — it turned out he had a gun.\"  In Chicago, the police have been applying machine learning and predictive analytics to police data sets, including crime incidents, arrests, and weather data. When data such as previous arrest records is combined with real-time IoT data, (i.e. sensor-influenced cameras that detect gunshots) it becomes easier to ascertain problem locations. Known as the ‘pre-crime’ initiative, it was implemented through The software used is HunchLab, a geographic prediction tool that employs data modeling to predict risk in specific areas across the city. At-risk regions are highlighted on-screen, while recommendations for action are displayed alongside the at-risk region information. The information is then collated into a ‘decision support system’ and made accessible to individual police officers on the beat. Adoption of pre-crime tech is beginning to trend in the US. PredPol, one of the leading systems on the market, is already being used by law enforcement in California, Florida, Maryland and other states. Aside from civil liberties concerns, however, a For example, when researchers in the US examined how PredPol predicts crime, they found something disturbing. The software apparently sets off a “feedback loop” that leads to law enforcement being dispatched repeatedly to certain neighborhoods--regardless of the actual crime rates in those neighborhoods. According to \"The problem stems from the logic that PredPol uses to decide where officers should be sent. If an officer is sent to a neighbourhood and then makes an arrest, the software takes this as indicating a good chance of more crimes in that area in future. What this means, says Matt Kusner at the Alan Turing Institute in London, is that the PredPol system seems to be learning from reports recorded by the police – which may be higher in areas where there are more police – rather than from underlying crime rates.\"  “That’s how dangerous feedback loops are,” Joshua Loftus, Assistant Professor of Information, Operations and Management Sciences, said. These loops are only part of how PredPol makes its predictions, he said, but they may explain why predictive policing algorithms have sometimes appeared to recreate exactly the type of biases the software developers say they overcome. So, the crime rate in one neighborhood is overestimated, without taking into account the It may be possible to terminate the feedback loop, though. Loftus also indicated there are several other issues that need to be resolved before policing algorithms can truly be considered unbiased. “Human decisions affect every aspect of the design of the system,” he cautioned. The mystery of the recent surge in port 8000 scan activity has been solved today by security researches from Qihoo 360 Netlab, who tracked this week's mystery traffic to an old foe —According to researchers, the publication of proof-of-concept (PoC) code on June 8 for a popular web server software package drew the attention of the Satori crew, who integrated that particular exploit into their botnet's attack routine. The exploit allows an attacker to send a malformed package via ports 80 or 8000 and execute code on the device, effectively taking it over. Scans for devices that had port 8000 exposed via their WAN interface started a day after the PoC's publication but picked up yesterday, June 14. The sudden surge in port 8000 activity turned the heads of multiple security experts specialized in botnet tracking, as it came out of nowhere and at an incredible scale. What's up with all the 8000/tcp traffic? — Bad Packets Report (@bad_packets) port 8000 scan is also jumping up now...stay tuned for more update Here's a link to the pcap file (traffic to  from port 8000).

Always possible that I missed something, though.         According to honeypot data from Naturally, scan activity targeting these two ports also grew similarly to the one seen on port 8000, and the Satori crew is trying to corral as many routers as it can before other botnets join the fold. After While some IoT botnets try to avoid the limelight by just re-routing traffic for other crooks, Satori is more of an in-your-face botnet, used to Indicators of compromise for the recent Satori versions are available in Mostly new variants of the same ransomware this week, with little new ransomware campaigns being conducted. Of particular interest was Kaspersky temporarily withdrawing their participation in the NoMoreRansom project and the rebranding of Satan Ransomware as DBGer Ransomware. Contributors and those who provided new ransomware information and stories this week include: Kaspersky Lab announced it was temporarily halting its cooperation with Europol following the voting of a controversial motion in the European Parliament today. The authors of the Satan ransomware have rebranded their \"product\" and they now go by the name of DBGer ransomware, according to security researcher A decryptor for the Everbe Ransomware was released by     Europol, French, UK, and Thai police arrested eight people they suspect to have been involved or to have been part of a notorious hacker group known as Rex Mundi (Latin for \"King of the World\"). The group has been active since at least 2012. Its modus operandi revolved around hacking into companies' networks, stealing private information, and later contacting the victims to request the payment of a ransom fee. Hackers demanded fees for not disclosing the hacks, but sometimes also asked for higher sums of money for revealing the security flaw they used to enter the victim's network. While the date the group formed is unknown, the earliest reports of Rex Mundi hacks go back to the summer of 2012. In the early 2010s, when hacker groups like Anonymous or LulzSec were a bit more brash about their hacks, Rex Mundi often bragged about their recent victims, announcing hacks According to a But as law enforcement started arresting hackers and hacktivists left and right, the group changed its modus operandi and eventually went underground. Rex Mundi abandoned its flashy mode of operation and continued to work in the shadows, without announcing their hacks online, to reporters, or leaking data when companies failed to pay. The group continued to operate until last year, according to Europol. The hack that undone them was of a British-based firm, whose network they'd breached, stole data from, and later attempted to extort. Days after this hack, Rex Mundi contacted the company via telephone and requested their usual ransom. According to Europol, a French-speaking person demanded payments in Bitcoin equivalent to €580,000 ($675,000) for not disclosing the hack and €825,000 ($960,000) for also revealing how they broke in. For each day the company failed to respond, Rex Mundi would add another €210,000 ($245,000) on top of the ransom fee. These sums are far from the initial ransom demands of $5,000 - $10,000 the group used to make in the early 2010s. The British company declined to pay, and instead contacted authorities. Information gathered by UK police led to the arrest of five French nationals a month later, in June 2017. One of these persons, the leader, admitted his role in the extortion scheme, while also revealing they didn't do any of the hacking but hired hackers on the Dark Web to do this instead. French police arrested two of these hackers in October 2017, and Thai police arrested a third in May 2018, effectively putting an end to one of the longer lasting hacking groups of this decade. An expert in Android security is warning users that some developers of crappy Android apps have come up with a new trick for fooling users into installing their apps. The trick relies on app devs registering Google Play Store developer accounts that mimic install counts, instead of their real name, such as \"1 million installs,\" Installs 1,000,000,\" \"100,000,000 Downloads,\" \"5,000,000+,\" \"1,000,000,000\" and other similar formats. The idea is that the official Google Play Store lists an app entry by displaying the app's icon, name, developer name, and a star rating. By replacing the developer name with a faux install count, some developers are trying to fool users into thinking the app is extremely popular, and hence, somewhat safe to use. But in reality, they are not. According to ESET malware researcher Lukas Stefanko, most of the apps using this trick that he analyzed were mostly adware. The majority were just empty shells, with little to no functionality except for showing ads on top of other apps or the user's screen. How to make your app popular:How easy it is to make user believe apps are highly downloaded(popular) and probably worth of trying.Furthermore, Stefanko also noticed another similar trick employed by some malicious app developers. While they didn't use developer accounts with misleading names that contained install counts, some app devs put the fake install counts in the app's icon that shows up in Play Store search results. This misleading image is intended to work the same way as the fake install counts inserted in the dev's account name and give users a false sense of confidence for apps that are clearly ill-intended. \"The tricks are simple, yet potentially effective, ways to mislead users, particularly those who choose apps based on popularity,\" Stefanko explains. \"While none of these apps were outright malicious, these techniques could easily be misused by malware authors in the future. Fortunately, the tricks are also simple to spot, if you know what to focus on.\" Things to keep in mind when installing an app: ?  Google embeds official information in special fields on the app's Play Store page. It does not use images to do so.Several gaming companies have announced plans to remove support for an analytics app they have bundled with their games. The decision to remove the app came after several Reddit and Steam users noticed that many game publishers have recently embedded a controversial analytics SDK (software development kit) part of recent updates to their games. The program bundled with all these games, and at the heart of all the recent controversy, is RedShell, an analytics package provided by Innervate, Inc., to game publishers. Game makers are supposed to embed this SDK within their games and run social marketing programs with specific affiliate IDs. If a new user buys and installs a game via one of these campaigns, the RedShell SDK embedded in the game pings back the publishers about the source of the new install. But in several recent online discussions, users are complaining that besides logging the source of a new game install, the app also creates fingerprints for each gamer, with information about their online personas and gaming rigs. Furthermore, many game studios have not told users that this SDK is now part of their games, or if they did, they made it an opt-out package instead of opt-in, as most privacy laws across the globe dictate. For the past two weeks, gamers have been spending their time digging through their games' files looking for the presence of RedShell files and processes, and then filing official complaints with the game publishers via online forums, Reddit, Steam, or official websites. Following this concentrated effort from the online gaming community, many gaming studios have responded to criticism and have removed or pledged to remove RedShell from their products. At the time of this article's publication, this is the status of games running RedShell and studios that promised to remove it. As this article ages, you'll be able to get an updated list of games running Redshell via this It has been reported that a GPU Miner Trojan is being installed along with the popular Andy Android emulator and its users are rightfully concerned. This miner reportedly will use the graphics processing unit, or GPU, on the computer's graphic's card in order to mine cryptocurrency. In a post What is concerning is that the Reddit poster has stated that he has tried to bring this up to the team via the Facebook user group numerous times and has been repeatedly kicked out each time.  When I downloaded and tested the According to VirusTotal, the Andy installer is When testing the current Andy installer, I was presented with offers for Avast, the Even after declining all of these offers, a program was still installed on my test computer. Guess what? It was a file called C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Updater\\updater.exe. For me, though, the program just generated an error when it was executed. If this file is indeed a GPU miner, I could be receiving this error because I am running it on a virtual machine that does not have a dedicated graphics card on it. When scanning it using The updater.exe file posted by the Reddit, though, is clearly When testing the Andy installer using the sandbox site Any.Run, you This GoogleUpdate.exe program has a description of \"AndyOS Update\", which indicates it's part of Andy. Why it is named GoogleUpdate is not known, but I feel it is strange. Furthermore, the GoogleUpdate.exe file is code signed by \"Andy OS Inc\". This indicates that the file belongs to Andy OS Inc or at least was intentionally signed by them. Finally the signature further indicates that it belong to Andy OS Inc. As the GoogleUpdate.exe is signed using a signature that is owned by Andy OS Inc, it would indicate that this file it one that belongs to them. While Bleeping Computer has not been able to corroborate that Andy is installing Miners onto user's computers, we could confirm that it is creating an Updater.exe executable as described by the Reddit user's post. For now, it is advised that users do not install Andy until further information is given by the Andy developers. Below is the video created by TopWire that demonstrates what he saw when installing Andy. Bleeping Computer has reached out to both the marketing contact and support contacts at Andy OS for comment, but have not heard back at the time of this publication. When it was released back in 2015, one of the main perks of Windows 10 was the improved security features that made it harder for rootkits to get a foothold on Microsoft's new OS. But three years later, security researchers from Romania-based antivirus vendor Bitdefender say they've discovered a new adware strain named Zacinlo that uses a rootkit component to gain persistence across OS reinstalls, a rootkit component that's even effective against Windows 10 installations. In fact, researchers say that 90% of all Zacinlo's recent victims are Windows 10 users, showing that crooks intentionally designed their \"product\" to work against Microsoft's latest OS. But it wasn't always so. According to researchers, the group behind Zacinlo have been in business since 2012, and have been distributing their malware all this time. The adware's distribution came in surges of activity, with big spikes in 2014, 2015, and especially in 2017 and 2018. It is believed that in these two past years, Zacinlo added its rootkit component that can work on Windows 10. \"The adware components are silently installed by a downloader that is presented as a free and anonymous VPN service (s5Mark),\" Bitdefender experts wrote in a 102-page report detailing Zacinlo's modus operandi and all of its modules released today. Finding a powerful threat like Zacinlo in the s5Mark app isn't a surprise as this app was previously categorized as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program) for a long time [This VPN app —actually more of a proxy— didn't and still doesn't do that much, to begin with, but it serves its purpose of initial point of infection and \"downloader\" for Zacinlo's other modules. Of all these modules, the rootkit one is the most important, as it can ensure the adware survives on infected hosts for weeks, months, or years. Furthermore, this same rootkit module is also utilized to stop processes deemed dangerous to the functionality of the adware while also protecting the adware from being stopped or deleted. There is also a module for carrying out man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks to intercept traffic, even HTTPS one. While this feature could allow it to intercept banking sessions and tamper with online payments, Zacinlo has been using this feature mainly to injects ads into any web pages it wants. Another module that stands out is one that can detect and remove competing adware. Bitdefender says this module isn't very advanced, but is something not seen in most adware families. Zacinlo also comes with regular adware components that harvest local system information, transmit it to a remote command and control server, and then receive commands from it. These commands allow the adware's master to uninstall or delete any local services he deems dangerous, like the ones specific to security software. But besides the rootkit and the MitM component there is another Zacinlo module that sends shivers down your back, and that's its \"screenshoting\" module that can take screengrabs off the victim's screen, similar to a feature often found in RATs (remote access trojans). \"This functionality has a massive impact on privacy as these screen captures may contain sensitive information such as e-mail, instant messaging or e-banking sessions,\" Bitdefender says. Further, Zacinlo also comes with a self-update feature to upgrade its components with new versions, the ability to install any software it wants on the victims' systems, a \"redirector\" module to make users forcibly navigate to a web page, and an ad replacer to push its own ads part of affiliate schemes into users' browsing sessions. Last but not least, Zacinlo also runs a Chromium-based headless browser in the background where it loads web pages and ads on which it silently clicks to generate profits for crooks. Overall, this is a dangerous threat that's been silently spreading for the least six years, and most of its victims have been spotted in the US, with others also seen in France, Germany, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Apple's macOS surreptitiously creates and caches thumbnails for images and other file types stored on password-protected / encrypted containers (hard drives, partitions), according to Wojciech Regu?a and Patrick Wardle, two macOS security experts. The problem is that these cached thumbnails are stored on non-encrypted hard drives, in a known location and can be easily retrieved by malware or forensics tools, revealing some of the content stored on encrypted containers. On macOS, these thumbnails are created by Finder and QuickLook. Finder is the default macOS file explorer app, similar to Windows Explorer. Whenever a user navigates to a new folder, Finder automatically loads icons for the files located in those folders. For images, these icons are gradually replaced by thumbnails that show a preview of the image at a small scale. But in a recent macOS version, Apple has added a new feature to Finder called QuickLook. This feature allows users to hold down the Space key while having a file selected and view an image-like preview of the document's content. Apple devs created this feature to allow users to preview files with similar names and determine which one they want to open. Under the hood, these QuickLook previews are nothing more than images, similar to the thumbnails Finder creates for photos. Both types of thumbnails are created and stored in the same location, at: Users using encrypted containers to safeguard files from intrusive eyes may be unaware that they might be leaking information via the thumbnail cache or via the QuickLook functionality. According to Wardle, this \"leak\" has been known about for at least eight years and has been a professional secret known by many forensics experts [However, with political regimes around the world cracking down on dissident voices with top-of-the-line tech and increased brutality, both Wardle says that by running the following two commands after unmounting an encrypted container, users can delete the thumbnail cache (and reboot the computer), and clear any compromising thumbnails from the non-encrypted section of their OS. Axis Communications AB, a Swedish manufacturer of network cameras for physical security and video surveillance, has patched seven security flaws across nearly 400 security camera models. The vulnerabilities came to light following an analysis of Axis firmware by VDOO, a cyber-security firm. VDOO experts analyzed the vendor's firmware as part of an internal initiative focused on the security of IP cameras, named Project Vizavis. The seven vulnerabilities discovered by VDOO experts include the following: VDOO published a technical report today detailing each flaw in depth, along with proof-of-concept code to reproduce the behavior in older Axis firmware. Experts notified the vendor about these flaws, and the Swedish company released firmware updates. The company published the following To exploit the flaws, an attacker would need to know a camera's IP address, but this isn't an issue nowadays when most botnets scan the entire IPv4 address space looking for vulnerable devices. The vulnerabilities are not overly dangerous when taken one by one, but VDOO says that by chaining three of them —CVE-2018-10660, CVE-2018-10661, and CVE-2018-10662— an attacker would be able to take over vulnerable devices without knowing their credentials. VDOO says that an attacker who has gained control over a camera can perform various actions including, but not limited to: Security researchers said they have not detected or are not aware of any attempts to exploit these flaws at the time of publishing. Device owners are advised to install the patched firmware as soon as possible. Other mitigation advice is included in VDOO's technical report on the matter. Previously in Project Vizavis, VDOO experts revealed several Three-quarters of malware samples uploaded to \"no-distribute scanners\" are never shared on \"multiscanners\" like VirusTotal, and hence, they remain unknown to security firms and researchers for longer periods of time. Although some antivirus products will eventually detect this malware at runtime or at one point or another later in time, this leaves a gap in terms of operational insight for security firms hunting down up-and-coming malware campaigns. A multiscanner is a service like Google's VirusTotal that aggregates antivirus (AV) scanning engines into one big melting pot, allowing users to upload a suspicious file and scan it simultaneously on all the AV engines hosted on the service. If at least one of the multiscanner's engines finds the file suspicious, the service shares the result among all AV companies, allowing cyber-security firms insight on new types of malware that their engines are not currently detecting. On the other hand, a no-distribute scanner is a service similar to a multiscanner, only that its operators modify the AV engines so they cannot report back to their respective vendors, hence limiting their ability to see the malware uploaded on such a service. As you'd image, no-distribute scanners are quite in demand on the cyber-criminal underground, and they have been in demand for years, with several services appearing and disappearing across the years, some going down on their own, while others after law enforcement intervention [But besides not sharing data with AV makers, no-distribute scanners have another downside, and that's the fact they don't provide APIs or open their data to outsiders. As such, the only way someone would know what has been uploaded and scanned on a no-distribute scanner is by having a direct link to a scan result. Such links are only available if malware authors who are advertising their malware share the results on forums, marketplaces, Telegram channels, private websites, or in other places. Collecting these links is what Recorded Future, a US-based cyber-security firm, has been doing in the past months. From January 1, 2018, to May 18, 2018, the company's experts have been gathering such links and comparing the MD5 hashes of the scanned files with the files scanned on multiscanners like VirusTotal. \"Only 25 percent [of these files] can be found on at least one traditional multiscanner, while the remaining 75 percent have never been seen,\" Recorded Future experts said in a \"Of the 25 percent [files] detected by multiscanners, 45 percent were first seen by a no distribute scanner and 55 percent were first seen by a traditional multiscanner,\" they added. The results can be interpreted in various ways. First and foremost, this means that most malware authors are generally aware of the fact they should not upload their malware on multiscanners, especially in the in-dev and post-launch stage of their malware's development cycle. Those who do might find that AV engines might become fully-aware of their tools and have detection rules in place by the time they deploy their malware in real-world campaigns, or just hours or days after they've started distribution efforts. These results also show that cyber-security firms do not have all the answers, and creating a good antivirus engine is not always enough. Most companies will also need an astute threat intelligence hunting team that can track down these links wherever they might be shared and add detection for malware not uploaded on places like VirusTotal. Apple announced today that the next version of the iOS operating system —iOS 12— would automatically and securely share a caller's geo-location with 911 emergency services across the US. The goal is to give 911 call centers quick access to location data in extreme cases where the caller cannot relay this information on his own. To do this, Apple says iOS 12 will use two technologies. The first is HELO (Hybridized Emergency Location), a system that Apple developed and launched in 2015. HELO works by estimating a 911 caller's location using cell towers and on-device data sources like GPS and WiFi Access Points. The second technology is a custom Internet-based protocol developed by RapidSOS, a US-based startup. This protocol's purpose is to quickly and securely share HELO location data with 911 call centers. RapidSOS' protocol is already integrated with many US 911 emergency centers, which makes Apple's new iOS 12 feature production-ready from the minute it's scheduled to launch this fall. Other 911 call centers will have to upgrade equipment to be capable of receiving this data. The technology will come in hand as 80 percent of 911 calls made today come from mobile devices, while the rest come classic landlines. While some of these mobile devices do not have geo-location detection features, most of them do, and in the US, a large chunk of them run Apple's iOS. Apple's new feature is in the spirit of recent FCC regulation that requires that mobile carriers must be able to pinpoint 911 callers to within 50 meters at least 80 percent of the time by 2021. Two former FCC heads —Tom Wheeler, FCC Chairman from 2013 to 2017, and Dennis Patrick, FCC Chairman from 1987 to 1989— have applauded Apple's move. \"Helping 911 services quickly and accurately assess caller location has been a major issue since my time at the FCC,\" Patrick said. \"This advancement from Apple and RapidSOS will be transformative for emergency response in the United States.\" The Department of Justice has announced new charges against former CIA software engineer Joshua Schulte for allegedly leaking classified CIA documents, software projects, and hacking utilities Today, federal prosecutors have charged Schulte with 3 charges related to the theft and disclosure of the \"Joshua Schulte, a former employee of the CIA, allegedly used his access at the agency to transmit classified material to an outside organization,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman. “During the course of this investigation, federal agents also discovered alleged child pornography in Schulte’s New York City residence.  We and our law enforcement partners are committed to protecting national security information and ensuring that those trusted to handle it honor their important responsibilities.  Unlawful disclosure of classified intelligence can pose a grave threat to our national security, potentially endangering the safety of Americans.” The new charges are: When the Vault 7 tools were released by WikiLeaks it showed a deep and scary insight into how the CIA was utilizing hacking tools and methods to monitor computers, cell phones, televisions, webcams, SSL connections, and more. These tools had a wide range of uses from listening in on rooms using Samsung TVs to building malware for Windows. For more information on the tools that were released and what they were being used for, you can review our previous coverage of the Vault 7 leaks below: The US Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) yesterday that includes a clause to reinstate a ban on Chinese hardware vendor ZTE. Since the Chinese vendor heavily relies on US-made Qualcomm chips for its equipment, the ban dealt a huge blow to ZTE's production line, and the vendor openly admitted it risked going under. But following lobby efforts from Chinese President Xi Jinping, US President Donald Trump intervened and asked the Department of Commerce to reconsider the ban and work out a deal that would \"save Chinese jobs\" and allow ZTE to continue. The reworked Department of Commerce sanction lifted the US sales ban against ZTE, imposed a fine of $1 billion on the Chinese vendor, and dictated that a US compliance team be embedded at ZTE for the next 10 years to make sure the company remains compliant with US legislation. But President Trump's handout to ZTE, which he said was a personal favor for President Xi, irked many members of Congress, on both parties, which, in a rare sight, collaborated to have NDAA amended to include a clause to reinstate the original Department of Commerce sales ban. \"We're heartened that both parties made it clear that protecting American jobs and national security must come first when making deals with countries like China, which has a history of having little regard for either,\" said a group of US senators from both parties in a joint statement. \"It is vital that our colleagues in the House keep this bipartisan provision in the bill as it heads towards a conference,\" the group added. The Senate passed the NDAA with an 85 to 10 vote. The House of Representatives also passed the NDAA, but without the ZTE sales ban clause. Now, the two legislative bodies must work together and hash out a compromise. \"We must work with our colleagues in the House to ensure we pass a final bill, as well as a defense appropriations bill, before the end of the fiscal year,\" Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), one of the group's members, said yesterday. We’re heartened that both parties made it clear that protecting American jobs and national security must come first when making deals with countries like China, which has a history of having little regard for either. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) Here is US authorities are also pondering a similar ban against The admin consoles of over 22,000 container orchestration and API management systems are currently exposed online, according to a report published on Monday by Lacework, a company specialized in cloud security. In its report, the company analyzed the breadth of the problem of cloud management systems left exposed online, focusing on container orchestration systems, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesos Marathon, Redhat Openshift, Portainer.IO, and Swarmpit. These are web-based administration panels that system administrators in small and large companies alike use to manage container-based cloud infrastructure inside their companies. By default, these systems don't need to be exposed online, unless a company has staff spread across large geographical areas who need access to these systems to manage their infrastructure. But Lacework researchers warn that many of these systems aren't properly secured behind firewalls or restricted to virtual private networks (VPNs), meaning anyone can find them with basic pen-testing tools or with IoT search engines like Shodan. \"Although the vast majority of these management interfaces have credentials set up, there is little reason why they should be world-accessible and are far more vulnerable than they should be,\" Lacework says. \"These nodes are essentially openings to these organization’s cloud environments to anyone with basic skills at searching the web,\" the company added. \"These organizations, and the others who willLacework says it found 22,672 of these container orchestration management panels exposed online, of which, 305 had no password set up. Researchers also discovered 38 Kubernetes servers running a security  health check service called \"healthz\" that was also left with no authentication at all. Over 95 percent of these containers were hosted on Amazon's Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, and 58 percent of these were hosted on an AWS US region. More than three-quarters of these exposed panels were running Kubernetes instances, according to a graph compiled based on the Lacework research. For the past few years, infosec news sites have constantly been reporting of breaches caused by sysadmins forgetting to set a password for their MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Kubernetes, —and so on— servers. Olympic Destroyer, the malware that hit Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics, is still alive and infecting new victims, according to a report published earlier today by Russian antivirus vendor Kaspersky Labs. The company's security researchers say they've detected Olympic Destroyer infections across Europe in May and June 2018. New victims include financial organizations in Russia, and biological and chemical threat prevention laboratories in Europe and Ukraine. \"The variety of financial and non-financial targets could indicate that the same malware was used by several groups with different interests – i.e. a group primarily interested in financial gain through cybertheft and another group or groups looking for espionage targets,\" \"This could also be a result of cyberattack outsourcing, which is not uncommon among nation state actors,\" experts added. \"On the other hand, the financial targets might be another false flag operation by an actor who has already excelled at this during the Pyeongchang Olympics to redirect researchers’ attention.\" When the Kaspersky team is referencing Olympic Destroyer's \"false flag\" capabilities, it's referring to some of the malware's features, which have been borrowed from the arsenal of other cyber-espionage groups. Previously, experts found that parts of the Olympic Destroyer malware had used portions of tools developed by North Korea-linked Lazarus Group, and three Chinese cyber-espionage groups. In today's report, Kaspersky claims that \"some of the TTPs and operational security\" used in recent Olympic Destroyer campaigns resembles those used by the Sofacy APT, a Russian-linked cyber-espionage group also known as APT28 and Fancy Bear. The Kaspersky conclusion gives credence to a February Washington Post As for the recent Olympic Destroyer campaigns, Kaspersky says crooks have been using good ol' spear-phishing techniques to trick victims into opening boobytrapped Office documents. Malicious doc used in recent These documents contain macro code that runs a PowerShell script which disables PowerShell logging and downloads and infects the victim with Olympic Destroyer. For these recent attacks, Kaspersky says hackers downloaded the Olympic Destroyer binaries from websites running Joomla 1.7.3, a very outdated version of the Joomla PHP-based CMS. As we've covered in our two previous articles on Olympic Destroyer [Attacks with data wipers are all the rage right now, as another group, believed to be North Korean in origin, has deployed the KillDisk data wiper after The data wiper crashed the bank's systems, keeping its IT employees busy restoring the bank's main services while hackers were siphoning money from its main account. Jason Sun, the man behind the The acquisition closed last week, according to an inside source who spoke to Negotiations between the two companies started last September, according to a TorrentFreak Things got rocky between Sun and BitTorrent management last year after the two parties signed a letter of intent that prohibited BitTorrent from seeking and hearing offers from competitors. Sun sued BitTorrent last year for breaching the letter's terms after he got wind that the company was hearing other offers. In spite of the rocky beginning, the two sides settled their differences and Sun dropped its lawsuit in February. Soon after, Sun registered a new California company called Rainberry Acquisition, which for a few months remained a mystery to observers until BitTorrent Inc. rebranded into Rainberry, a clear sign the two had reached an agreement. The two companies reportedly filed a change of status motions with the California Secretary of State last week, on the same day, citing \"merger\" as the reason. It is unclear what Sun plans to do with BitTorrent's core business, but many cryptocurrency experts have noticed today that Sun's TRON cryptocurrency whitepaper had referenced BitTorrent several times, meaning he was familiar with the technology and its power. BitTorrent is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) that's at the base of today's torrent clients. The technology was extremely popular in the 2000s and up until the mid-2010s, but it has died down in recent years as most users shifted from desktops to mobiles and mobile apps. In its heyday, BitTorrent Inc. claimed the BitTorrent client had around 150 million monthly active users. BitTorrent Inc, the company behind the BitTorrent protocol, later acquired the uTorrent client, and attempted several times to push its technology to Silicon Valley and music industry firms, but failed. Several execs shuffled through the company, and its founder has left a few years back, opting to create his own cryptocurrency called Chia. Sun's TRON is today the Cyber-criminals are currently using a trick that allows them to bypass Microsoft's security filters and deliver spam and phishing emails to Office 365 email accounts. Called ZeroFont, the technique is not new, being known for decades, and relies on interposing zero-width font characters inside normal text. While a human reader will not see the zero-width characters, the entire text, including the hidden characters, will be visible to email security software. The goal is to trick the email security system into thinking this is a giant block of rambling text, but show human recipients the \"lure\" of the phishing emails. The technique has been known and used for years, and most email security systems will usually mark emails as suspicious if they contain text with zero-width settings. But according to Avanan, a company specialized in cloud security, Microsoft's Office 365 platform does not mark these emails as malicious. By inserting large quantities of hidden zero-width text inside an email's body, crooks are hiding these indicators from the Office 365 natural language processing engine, effectively drowning their \"lure\" in a sea of random words, which are invisible to the human eye, but not to Microsoft's system. Avanan says it detected the ZeroFont technique currently being used in the wild, alongside other tricks that involve Last month, Avanan researchers also discovered that Office 365 was also not detecting links to phishing sites that were split into two parts A hacker once considered \"the Internet’s most inept criminal\" received on Monday a prison sentence of 20 months in prison for launching DDoS attacks against the city of Madison, Wisconsin —attacks which caused delays and outages to various municipality services, including its 911 emergency call center. The DDoS attacks took place between March 9 and March 14, 2015, and the man's name is Randall Charles Tucker, 23, a hacker who went online under the pseudonym of \"Bitcoin Baron.\" Authorities filed charges against Tucker in August 2016, two years after the Baron started his hacking career which mostly included defacing websites and launching a long string of DDoS attacks against various entities that he came across in his daily routine. Attacks didn't follow a particular pattern, and Tucker never bothered hiding his actions, often announcing upcoming or past attacks on his Twitter timeline and in public and private chatrooms. For the time, Tucker was your regular confused hacktivist who took up arms against causes he saw as unjust, including launching attacks part of #OpSeaWorld, an operation of the Anonymous hacker collective against the maltreatment of ocean life inside SeaWorld parks. Other victims of his rage included the networks of various US municipalities, childrens' hospitals, news sites, web hosting firms, banks, gaming servers, and the homepages of other hacker groups. Most of the attacks were short-lived, as Tucker moved from target to target in a quick pace. His most publicized hacks were when he defaced the website of the Shriners Hospitals for Children with child pornography, when he attacked the website of the But Bitcoin Baron was never a hacker admired for his dedication or skills. He infamously botched a \"social justice operation\" against the San Marcos Police Department when he hacked into the department's website and left a message demanding the jailing of an officer who was accused of beating, injuring, and illegally arresting a student. Unknown to Tucker was that the officer in question had been fired and jailed two years prior to his attack. Tucker also launched DDoS attacks against News2Share.com, a user-generated video-based news portal, on two different occasions, demanding they feature one of his self-made hacker \"call for arms\" videos. The site gave in to his demands and eventually featured the video, only to get a few hundred views from his effort, and almost no national media attention, as he was hoping. According to court documents, Tucker was never keen on operational security (OpSec), which allowed law enforcement to gather troves of information about his past actions, making the case an easy win for prosecutors. The prosecution said Tucker relished the mayhem he caused with his DDoS attack against the city of Madison, which affected first-responders, hospitals, the county jail, and government email communications throughout the area. Prosecutors said that in a Skype chat with a fellow hacker, Tucker forwarded links to news articles about the fallout from his DDoS attacks and boasted that he was \"becoming quite famous on the net.\" He gleefully said, \"this shit is exciting.\" Tucker also bragged that he has \"done this for 2 years\" and \"haven’t been caught.\" Some part of this reckless hacking and DDoS spree appears to have taken place after Tucker was arrested and released pre-trial for aggravated assault after stabbing his father with a kitchen knife. He was later sentenced to a 1.5-year prison sentence and surrendered himself to a state prison two months after his Madison DDoS attacks. Tucker told fellow hackers he was \"shutting down sites and getting myself on the news as Bitcoin Baron before I go,\" most likely referring to his pending prison sentence. In hindsight, the following tweet didn't age pretty well, as this came just before his initial 1.5 years sentencing, and as authorities were slowly retracing his hacks and getting ready to levy new charges. Fuck Prison, Fuck the System, Fuck all you officers and fuck you government. — Dead Acc (@_Bitcoin_Baron_) In a Tucker pleaded guilty to the hacking-related charges in April 2017. The prosecution asked for a 41-month prison sentence, according to a sentencing memorandum, but the judge handed down a 20-month prison sentence instead. He was also ordered to pay $69,000 in restitution. VirusTotal announced today a new paid service called \"VirusTotal Monitor\" that will alert subscribers when their program have been detected by antivirus vendors as malware. This allows developers and the antivirus vendor to be immediately notified in order to quickly clean up the incorrect detection, or false positive, in the program. For a software developer, one of the most aggravating problems is when antivirus vendors detect your program as a malware when it is actually harmless. These false positives tarnish a developer's reputation, gets you added to other antivirus vendor's definitions, and could ultimately cause a major loss of revenue as browsers and search engines block your visitors from downloading your program. I know the aggravation of FPs first hand as my program This is why VirusTotal Monitor could be helpful to many developers as it makes it easier to keep their software detected properly without having to do much work on their own. Subscribers of When uploading files to Monitor, users will use a Google Drive like interface that allows you to store your monitored files in a private storage bucket. VirusTotal has told BleepingComputer that the files uploaded to \"VT Monitor are not accessible via VirusTotal Intelligence unless the file has been uploaded through the traditional VT services (public interface or API)\". This means that files uploaded through Monitor are private and not available to any other VirusTotal users, including Intelligence users. While the files remain in this bucket, VirusTotal will perform a daily scan of each one and check if any detections have changed.  If a change in detections is detected, notifications will be immediately sent out to begin the process of clearing the false positives. The best part of this service is that VirusTotal will automatically send a notification to a subscriber For many developers, this is enough reason to pay for this service. At this time it is not known how much this service will cost. Based on some of the information requested when you Thankfully, VirusTotal understands that it's the smaller developers that are hit the hardest by false positives and are going to price the service so it is accessible to everyone. \"This service is focused for both small developers and big companies. In this initial phase we will be targeting only big companies. This will help us calibrate and evaluate the process followed by VT Monitor to help with false positives. After this we will open VT Monitor to small software developers as well and we expect it to have a pricing model which makes it accessible to everyone,\" VirusTotal told BleepingComputer. \"Small developers are really the most affected by false positives and we aim specially at helping them solve this in an efficient and cost effective manner with VT Monitor.\" A demonstration of VirusTotal Monitor has been posted to YouTube and can be seen below.   A cyber-espionage group believed to be operating out of China hacked companies who develop satellite communications, geospatial imaging, and defense contractors from both United States and Southeast Asia. The hacks were detected by US cyber-security firm Symantec, who said today in a report that intruders showed particular interest in the operational side of the breached companies. Hackers tried to reach and paid close attention to infecting computer systems used for controlling communications satellites or those working with geospatial data collected by world-mapping satellites. \"This suggests to us that [the group]’s motives go beyond spying and may also include disruption,\" Symantec said. There are fears that hackers might be able or even attempt to sabotage satellites or poison geospatial data. The company said that responsible for the attacks was an advanced persistent threat (APT, a term used to describe cyber-espionage groups) known under the codename of Thrip. Symantec says it's been tracking this group since 2013, and it has historically believed the group to be operating out of China. The recent attacks were difficult to detect, the company said. Hackers used a technique known as \"living off the land,\" which consists of using local tools already available on the operating system to carry out malicious operations. \"The purpose of living off the land is twofold,\" Symantec explained. \"By using such features and tools, attackers are hoping to blend in on the victim’s network and hide their activity in a sea of legitimate processes. Secondly, even if malicious activity involving these tools is detected, it can make it harder to attribute attacks.\" According to Symantec, hackers used the following locally-installed and completely legitimate tools... ...to install custom-made malware such as: Symantec says it detected these attacks only after one of its artificial intelligence and machine learning-based triggered an alert for a suspicious use of a legitimate tool. Experts say they've used this initial alert to uncover initial signs of compromise and then pulled on a thread to uncover a broader operation targeting multiple companies across multiple countries and industry sectors. The purpose of this hacking campaign was obvious cyber-espionage. The company says it uncovered this operation in January, but the Thrip hacking campaign could be broader than the company has currently reported. The OpenBSD project announced today plans to disable support for Intel CPU hyper-threading due to security concerns regarding the theoretical threat of more \"Spectre-class bugs.\" The feature has been added to all Intel CPUs released since 2002 and has come enabled by default, with Intel citing its performance boost as the main reason for its inclusion. But today, Mark Kettenis of the OpenBSD project, said the OpenBSD team was removing support for Intel HT because, by design, this technology just opens the door for more timing attacks. The recently disclosed Meltdown and Spectre CPU vulnerabilities, along with their many variations [\"[Intel HT] can make cache timing attacks a lot easier and we strongly suspect that this will make several spectre-class bugs exploitable,\" Kettenis The OpenBSD team is now stepping in to provide a new setting to disable HT support because \"many modern machines no longer provide the ability to disable hyper-threading in the BIOS setup.\" \"This can [now] be controlled through a new hw.smt sysctl,\" Kettenis said. \"For now this only works on Intel CPUs when running OpenBSD/amd64. But we're planning to extend this feature to CPUs from other vendors and other hardware architectures.\" Kettenis says that SMT doesn't really have a positive effect on performance, as Intel and other CPU vendors have advertised, and the change shouldn't bring a big performance hit. For the second time in a year, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb has been hacked, and this time around, hackers stole the equivalent of 35 billion won ($31.6 million) worth of cryptocurrency. The attack took place on the night between June 19 and June 20, according to a statement on the company's website. Bithumb did not reveal any details about this latest hack, such as what cryptocurrency the hackers stole, how they got into their IT system, or how they exfiltrated funds. Some users reported on cryptocurrency-focused forums that they were missing Ripple (RPX) from their accounts, but this information was never confirmed by the exchange. In the aftermath of the hack, the company immediately blocked user withdrawals to prevent the hacker from stealing more funds. Bithumb then moved to relocate most of its funds to a cold (offline) wallet for safe-keeping, until it audits, rebuilds, and roots out the hackers from its IT system. The company is now warning users to not deposit new funds into their accounts or attempt to make payments, as the transactions could be lost during the system migration. [Notice for the temporary suspension of the deposits]*All deposit and withdrawal service will be stopped to make sure the security. We will keep notice you of the restart of the service. We apologize for your inconvenience and thanks for your understanding. — Bithumb (@BithumbOfficial) The company said it was planning to use its reserve funds to compensate all users who lost currency in the recent hack. Bithumb suffered Today's hack continues a year-long trend of South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges suffering hacks. Past victims include Bithumb was considered one of the top 10 most popular cryptocurrency exchanges on the market before today's hack. Bitcoin price fell 3 percent following Bithumb's announcement. The developer teams from Google Home, Roku TV, and Sonos, are preparing security patches to prevent DNS rebinding attacks on their devices. Roku has already started deploying updates, while Google and Sonos are expected to deploy patches next month. DNS rebinding is not a new attack vector by any stretch of the imagination. Researchers have known about it since 2007 when it was first detailed in a The purpose of a DNS rebinding attack is to make a device bind to a malicious DNS server and then make the device access unintended domains. DNS rebinding attacks are usually used to compromise devices and use them as relay points inside an internal network. A typical DNS rebinding attack usually goes through the following stages: In almost all cases, DNS rebinding attacks aren't used to redirect users to malicious external IPs, but for IPs on the local network. DNS rebinding attacks are dangerous when coupled with devices that do not feature security protections for requests made from the internal network. For example, an API endpoint or an admin panel that while secure against WAN requests, is left without authentication from LAN requests. For example, an attacker can trick a user into accessing malicious-site.com, and then use the malicious DNS server for malicious-site.com to make the user's browser access an URL in the form of \"http://192.168.0.1/router/enable/WAN\" and automatically configure the local router into opening its admin panel to external connections. But despite being known for more than a decade, DNS rebinding has largely gone under the radar because vendors didn't believe a threat actor would bother attempting such hacks. The reasons are that exploiting DNS rebinding flaws requires a multi-step process, lots of custom tools, and a lot of patience from attackers. Because of the many moving parts involved in such an attack, and the many possibilities of something going wrong, vendors believed hackers wouldn't have any interest in carrying out such hacks. Hence, very few products nowadays are hardened against DNS rebinding. However, in recent months, things have started to change. Interest into DNS rebinding flaws from well-known security researchers like Google's Tavis Ormandy has re-brought this issue into the limelight. Flaws have been discovered and fixed in products such as One of the latest deep-dives into DNS rebinding attacks comes from Chicago-based Brannon Dorsey. Yesterday, he published his latest research on the matter, which included a study of some modern IoT equipment and how they handle a DNS rebinding attack. To nobody's surprise, Dorsey found that most of the equipment he tested was vulnerable. For the past three months, he's badgered vendors to patch these issues and found no success until two members of the press got involved and also started asking questions on the topic. More below: Dorsey found that by using a DNS rebinding attack that binds a malicious domain to an undocumented REST API that runs on Google Home devices on port 8008, he could have access to a slew of commands such as the ability to launch apps, play content, scan and join nearby WiFi networks, reboot, and even factory reset the device. Furthermore, Dorsey argued that by collecting info on WiFi access points from victims, an attacker could also reverse engineer a user's geographical location based on publicly accessible databases that linked WiFi network SSIDs with real-world locations. Similar issues were also present on Chromecast devices, Dorsey said. The researcher reported the DNS rebinding attack vector to Google, but the company largely ignored his initial reports. The Google Home team changed its mind a few months later after a Tripwire security researcher The same DNS rebinding attack vector is also found on Roku devices (CVE-2018–11314). The researcher says that Roku devices expose an API server on port 8060, accessible from a user's internal network. An attacker could use a DNS rebinding attack to send requests to this API server and control basic device functions such as launching apps, searching, playing content, and even simulating keys input using a virtual keyboard app. Roku initially refused to acknowledge DNS rebinding as a feasible attack vector and a security risk for their devices. The company changed its mind after Dorsey The company anticipated that a patch would be released in three to four months, but expedited their work when Dorsey told them he was planning to publish Dorsey also discovered that Sonos WiFi speakers were also vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks (CVE-2018–11316). On these devices, Dorsey says an attacker can rebind an external domain to an internal UPnP endpoint on port 1400 that could be used as an intermediary for running Unix shell commands on the device. The researcher says these commands allow an attacker to \"map internal and external networks using the traceroute command and probe hosts with ICMP requests with ping using simple POST requests.\" \"An attacker could use a Sonos device as a pivot point to gather useful network topology and connectivity information to be used in a follow up attack,\" Dorsey said. Unlike Google and Roku, Sonos was far more responsive, and acknowledged the issue right away, promising a fix for mid-July as well. But besides smart home assistants, smart TV software, and smart speakers, Dorsey also looked how DNS rebinding affected home thermostats (CVE-2018–11315). He analyzed Radio Thermostat CT50  CT80 devices and found that DNS rebinding attacks worked via a yet-to-be-patched security issue from 2013 (CVE-2013–4860) that exposed the device's API via the internal network with no authentication at all. Dorsey found that he could interact with this API and alter room temperatures. \"[Changing] temperature can be dangerous, or even deadly in the summer months to an elderly or disabled occupant,\" he said. \"Not to mention that if your device is targeted while you’re on vacation you could return home to a whopper of a utility bill.\" The issue remains unfixed in Radio thermostats. As for WiFi routers, Dorsey didn't look into these types of devices. Nonetheless, he says most routers are most likely vulnerable. Knowing how many API and UPnP endpoints ship with most routers, DNS rebinding attacks are very likely to be possible on such devices, and the attack is more than ideal for IoT botnet herders. An attacker could use malicious ads (malvertising) to trick the user into making a DNS request to a malicious DNS server, and then, after the DNS rebinding has taken place, use the user's browser as a proxy to send requests to these API and UPnP endpoints with various commands. For example, an attacker could use default credentials to access the router's admin section and make changes to the device, or use the UPnP endpoints to alter Internet gateway settings, configuring HTTP proxies that run on routers —an attack type known as Dorsey hopes that his extensive research on the topic will raise awareness among IoT and smart device vendors about DNS rebinding attacks and the ease with which they can be carried out these days (thanks to malvertising). He hopes that vendors will feature the same levels of protection and security features on API endpoints exposed on the device's internal network, as they do for features exposed on the external WAN interface. The researcher also wants consumers to take notice as well. He recommends that users use services like Dorsey also published a Security researchers have spotted a new commercial malware product that's been put up for sale on hacking forums for the lowly price of only $50, paid in Bitcoin. Named Kardon Loader, this is a new malware strain, currently still under development, in a \"beta\" stage according to its author. Based on its advertised features Kardon is a \"malware loader,\" also known as a \"malware downloader\" or \"dropper,\" which is a type of malware strain that cyber-criminals usually deploy as the first stage of their operations. A malware loader's main role is to infect victims, gain persistence on a user's computer, and then report back to a command and control (CC) server. Each victim of a malware loader is called a \"bot,\" as the malware assembles all infected computers in a giant botnet. The inevitable future of every bot is that at one point or another, the \"loader\" will download a second-stage payload, usually a more potent malware, such as a banking trojan, a password-dumper, a backdoor trojan, or ransomware. Cybercriminals normally use malware loaders in two ways. They either incorporate them in their own custom multi-stage malware infection chains, for their own benefits, or they sell \"bot space\" to other crooks, who then infect users with the second-stage malware of their choice. In the past two decades, we've seen malware downloaders such as Andromeda, Nemucod, Quant Loader, or Smoke Loader, being very active on the market. Crooks have made good money selling these types of tools to other crooks, and especially \"bot space.\" It is this bot-space-selling niche that a relatively new malware author is trying to break into. According to an Arbor ASERT report published yesterday, a malware author named Yattaze started selling a new malware downloader named Kardon Loader last April. \"Kardon is a lot smaller of an operation than some of the well-known loaders out there like Smoke and Quant,\" TJ Nelson, Security Research Analyst for Arbor, told \"However, where its predecessors started adding mining and credential stealing features, Kardon Loader has limited those 'extras' and added control panel features [so buyers can] start their own botshop,\" Nelson told us. The researcher is referring to a somewhat unique Kardon Loader feature promoted in its advertisement. Usually, malware loaders come with a backend panel that lets buyers interact with their bots and send a second-stage malware. On top of this standard CC panel, Kardon also includes a fully-fledged botshop, a much rarer feature, which allows buyers of the original Kardon Loader to open an online store where they can sell access to the bots they collect. But for now, the malware is not a threat, as it still a newcomer on the market, and has fewer buyers. Arbor says it didn't find any active Kardon samples deployed in the wild. \"We have found most of our samples from multiscanning services, one panel (botshop) in the wild (via a Google search), and a few via the forum commentary,\" Nelson told us. \"Commentary from the actor reveals this bot is not widely distributed at this time,\" Nelson says. \"Only 124 infections are shown in a screenshot of the loader’s test network posted by the actor.\" In his ad, Yattaze also brags about Kardan's features: But from the Arbor team's analysis, Yattaze appears to have lied or exaggerated about a few of those features. For example, researchers didn't find any evidence of Tor integration or user mode rootkit functionality in the binaries they analyzed. Nonetheless, the Arbor team seems confident these features will be added in the future, as Yattaze is a trusted malware author with a good reputation for delivering on his goods. \"This is very new malware, and the author is active and responsive on their advertisement threads, which means the commitments they have made to add encryption and rootkit functionality have a higher likelihood of coming true in the future,\" Nelson told Previously to developing Kardon Loader, Yattaze worked on the ZeroCool botnet, a similar malware loader. \"The author abandoned the [ZeroCool] project and used the code from it to create Kardon Loader,\" Nelson told us. \"It was under development for over a year, and it was basically his first attempt at building a bot, so he decided not to release it and work on this one.\" The As of yesterday, Dutch owners of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2 are being greeted with a news message on Steam stating that they are no longer allowed to trade or perform marketplace transfers for items related to these games. This is due to Dutch law that found certain Loot Boxes to be considered gambling. In this message, Valve has stated that they have received letters from the Kansspelautoriteit, which is the Dutch Gaming Authority, that stated that the loot boxes in CS:GO and Dota 2 were in violation of their laws. More recently they received a threat from the Kansspelautoriteit stating that Steam must resolve these issues by June 20th or they would face legal action.. Due to this Valve has decided to temporarily disable trading and selling of these items until the issue can be resolved. \"So for now our only practical alternative is to disable trading and Steam Marketplace transfers for CS:GO and Dota 2 items for Dutch customers,\" stated the news on Steam. \"We apologize to you for this inconvenience. We hope that, after more engagement with the Kansspelautoriteit, they may refine their legal demands and we can find a solution that is less inconvenient.\" In April 2018, the Netherlands Gaming Authority released a report stating that 4 out of 10 loot boxes that they studied were considered gambling and broke Dutch law. This is because the contents of the loot boxes were determined by chance, can be traded outside of the game, and have a market value. \"The study revealed that four of the ten loot boxes that were studied contravene the law,\" stated the study by the The study went on to further state that there were concerns that these loot boxes could become addictive to certain players, especially young players. \"The analyses that are currently available indicate that all of the loot boxes that were studied could be addictive,\" stated the study. \"Loot boxes are similar to gambling games such as slot machines and roulette in terms of design and mechanisms. There are, however, no indications of loot boxes being opened on a large scale by problem players and/or addicted players. Socially vulnerable groups, such as young people, are being encouraged to play games of chance Publishers violating this law had until today, June 20th, 2018, to resolve these concerns within their games or face legal action by the Dutch Gaming Authority. Google is changing how the Play Store app is verifying the authenticity of Android apps before installation. The company plans to modify the header of APK (Android app) files to include a new metadata field that contains the app's file signature. Apps previously didn't include this field because they didn't need it, as Google-approved apps could be installed only via the official Play Store app, which handled all these checks in the background, before the app's installation. With the addition of an app file signature to the APK itself, Google is now allowing users to download official apps from the Play Store and distribute them via other channels, lest they not modify the apps in any way. \"One of the reasons we're doing this is to help developers reach a wider audience, particularly in countries where peer-to-peer app sharing is common because of costly data plans and limited connectivity,\" said James Bender, Product Manager of Google Play. \"In the future, [...] we'll be able to determine app authenticity while a device is offline,\" he added. When the user will try to side-load an app that he obtained through one of these peer-to-peer app sharing networks, the Play Store app will verify the additional metadata field and will be able to determine if the app came from the official Google Play Store, allowing the installation and syncing it with the phone's official app inventory. When the user comes back online, the app will be automatically be queued to receive updates from the Play Store, something that was not previously possible for apps side-loaded while the user was offline. Bender says this new app signature field will benefit developers because they have a broader channel for distributing apps, and won't be limited to the Play Store alone. The good news is that this change is seamless for app developers and users alike, who don't need to do anything. Google will be doing all the updating. \"We're adjusting Google Play's maximum APK size to take into account the small metadata addition, which is inserted into the Microsoft announced today that it's news aggregation service that powers MSN has been rebranded as Microsoft News. This engine is used to display a list of curated news stories gathered from more than a thousand publishers, which is then aggregated in their MSN news feeds and in their Microsoft News app for Android and iOS. According to Microsoft, more than 100,000 pieces of content are submitted to the Microsoft News engine, which is then processed by AI to determine the contents freshness, category, topic type, photos to pair with the content, and potential popularity. This content is then given to the Microsoft News editors who curate the stories that they feel should be promoted in the Microsoft News feed. \"This curation process is global, using editors with local expertise. Today, there are more than 800 editors working from 50 locations around the world – including editorial newsrooms serving multiple regions in India, Germany, France, Mexico, Canada and Spain,\" read As part of this announcement, Microsoft has also released an updated iOS and Android app called Like other news apps from Apple and Google, you can select news subjects that interest you and the app will use those interests to suggest the latest stories to you. When publishers partner with Microsoft to have their content displayed in the Microsoft News engine, both Microsoft and the publisher benefit. Microsoft gains access to almost unlimited content that can be displayed on MSN and in their apps and the publishers get a share of the advertising revenue. Microsoft stated that as part of this program they have paid more than $600 million to publishers in the past four years through this advertising revenue share. While this does reduce the potential visitors that may be going to a publishers site, it does give them greater exposure and still generates revenue. A weird Edge bug that was fixed earlier this month, allows a malicious website to retrieve content from other sites by playing audio files in a malformed manner that produces unintended consequences. \"This is a huge bug,\" said Jake Archibald, the Google developer who discovered this bug. \"It means you could visit my [proof-of-concept] site in Edge, and I could read your emails, I could read your Facebook feed, all without you knowing.\" The bug occurs when a malicious site uses Archibald says that because of inconsistencies in how browsers treat files loaded via service workers inside audio tags, it is possible to load any content inside the malicious site. Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be possible because of CORS —Cross-Origin Resource Sharing— a browser security feature that prevents sites from loading resources from other sites. But in this weird configuration, the attacker's site is able to issue \"no-cors\" requests that the receiving site —such as Facebook, Gmail, or BBC— will honor without any problems. This allows the attacking site to load content hidden behind authentication procedures, content that no online service in its right mind would allow to be loaded on random domains. The good news is that this bug is not universal, and has been fixed in all browsers at the time of writing. Archibald says the bug —which he jokingly named Only in-dev Firefox Nightly versions were affected, and Mozilla engineers fixed the issue in its Nightly version before the bug ever made it into the main Firefox Stable release.
