 tAt least one server used by an app for parents to monitor their teenagers' phone activity has leaked tens of thousands of accounts of both parents and children. tThe mobile app,tAlthough teen monitoring apps are controversial and privacy-invasive, the company says ittBut the Los Angeles, Calif.-based company left its servers, hosted on Amazon's cloud, unprotected and accessible by anyone without a password. t tBoth of the servers was pulled offline aftert"We have taken action to close one of our servers to the public and begun alerting customers that could potentially be impacted," said a TeenSafe spokesperson toldtThe database stores the parent's email address associated with their associated child's Apple ID email address. It also includes the child's device name -- which is often just their name -- and their device's unique identifier. The data contains the plaintext passwords for the child's Apple ID. Because the app requires None of the records contained content data, such as photos or messages, or the locations of either parents or children. tThe data also contained error messages associated with a failed account action, such as if a parent looking up a child's real-time location didn't complete. tShortly before the server went offline, there were at least 10,200 records from the past three months containing customers data -- but some are duplicates. tOne of the servers appeared to store test data, but it's not known if there are other exposed servers with additional data. tTeenSafe claims to have over a million parents using the service.(Screenshots: ZDNet)We began verifying some of the data by reaching out to those whose email addresses were named in the leaking data.

While we did not contact children for fear of causing alarm, some of the email addresses were associated with their high schools. It's not clear why the data, let alone passwords for teens' Apple IDs, was stored in plaintext.The company claims on its website that it's "secure" and uses encryption to scramble the data, such as in the event of a data breach. TeenSafe said it was continuing to assess the situation and "will provide additional information" as it becomes available.Zack Whittaker can be reached securely on Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755–8849, and his PGP fingerprint for email is: 4D0E 92F2 E36A EC51 DAAE 5D97 CB8C 15FA EB6C EEA5.
